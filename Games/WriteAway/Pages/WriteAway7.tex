\subsection{The Boy Left Out by Jack Lee}

NEWSPAPER ANNOUNCER (VOICE OVER):
Extra, extra!
Read all about it!
Oregon boy says they laughed when I wanted to play!
Third-grader Jack Lee from Eugene, Oregon, tells us all about it in his story The Boy Left Out.

NARRATOR:
This is the story of a kid named John.
John was an unhappy boy because he always got left out of team sports at school.

OSCAR:
All right, everybody, we're here now.
We can choose up sides to play a little tag football.

EVERYONE:
Yeah!

JOHN:
Oscar!
Oscar!
Oscar!
Can anybody play?

OSCAR:
Uh...
We'll see.
You pick first.

GIRL 1:
I pick Jim!

OSCAR:
Okay, I pick, uh, Sally!

SALLY:
Yeah!

GIRL 1:
Well, that takes care of everyone who really can play football.

SALLY:
Oh, here John, here.
Here's some money.
You go and buy us some sodas.

JIM:
Yeah, and if you're really lucky, maybe we'll let you cheerlead for us.

SALLY:
Hahaha!

OSCAR:
Come on, guys, let's go.

JOHN:
They may be laughing at me now, but someday, as Joe Montana is my witness, I will play football.

NARRATOR:
John never got picked to play sports, but he didn't give up.
Then one day, John's big chance came.
Jim was hurt, and the team was one man short.

OSCAR:
Well, Jim's out.
Looks like you'll have to forfeit because you don't have another player.
Hahaha!

JOHN:
Let me play!
Let me play!
Please, look, look, me me me, hello!
Please please please please please!

GIRL 1:
Oh, I guess I'll have to take John.
Okay, John, you better be good or else.

JOHN:
Don't worry, just passing that pigskin!
Yay!

OSCAR:
Wow, John, you were wonderful!
From now on, I'm always putting you on my team.

GIRL 1:
No way!
My team!

OSCAR:
No, my team!

NARRATOR:
Yes!
John could play football!
But one day, the game changed to baseball, and with that went John's luck.

SALLY:
Strike three.
You're out!

OSCAR:
Boy, John, you really stink at this game.
I think you should stick to football.

JOHN:
You're right.
I will stick to football.
And I'm gonna practice every day.
I'm gonna lift weights, I'm gonna eat right, and I'm not gonna go out with girls on school nights.
Sorry.
And I'm gonna get really good grades because when I grow up, I'm gonna be in the NFL!

NARRATOR:
And now John does play in the NFL as a wide receiver.

NFL MANAGER:
Oh, if I had nine more like him, I could rule the world!

CHEERLEADER:
Yaay John!

JOHN:
I've learned a valuable lesson.
If you have a dream, never, ever give up.
Just keep on trying.

Aiming for a good life, I am always nice.

\subsection{A Treasure Hunt by Carley Moore \& Abby Mathis}

NEWSPAPER ANNOUNCER (VOICE OVER):
Read all about it!
Pirate saves beautiful princess.
Take a trip with kindergartner Carley Moore and fourth-grader Abby Mathis from Alps Road School in Athens, Georgia, as they go on a treasure hunt.

SCOUT (VOICE OVER):
Once long ago, there lived a pirate, a mean pirate who hated all around him.
He only loved one thing - his pet parrot.

CAPTAIN:
Oh, me beautiful bird, why won't you eat?
You haven't spoken for two days.
You're the only thing here I love in this whole world.
That is, except for me treasure!

SCOUT (VOICE OVER):
Now, on this ship, there were also two very good pirates who took care of the mean pirate.

PIRATE 1:
Arr, I'm all done swabbing the deck.
And if I say so myself, this deck is so shiny I can almost see myself in it!

PIRATE 2:
Arr!
And I'm done peeling these potatoes for the wonderful shepherd's pie I'm baking for dinner.
But I'm worried about the captain - he keeps trying to feed his parrot.

PIRATE 1:
Aye.

PIRATE 2:
Maybe one of us should break the news to him that we think Polly left this world a week ago.

PIRATE 1, PIRATE 2:
Nah.

SCOUT (VOICE OVER):
They sailed on and on until one day, when the mean pirate came up with a plan.

CAPTAIN:
Arr, I've got to hide me treasure so that no one will find it, and then I'll claim it later.
What's this I see?
Why, it's an island!
Well, get me treasure, and we'll bury it on that island.
Let's get in the rowboat, let's go!

SCOUT (VOICE OVER):
The mean pirate was gone, and soon the good pirates realized this.

PIRATE 2:
You know, it seems awfully quiet around here.

PIRATE 1:
Aye, I wonder, where's the captain?
Look, there he goes on that island to bury the treasure.
The treasure that we helped him get.

PIRATE 2:
Aar, how rude.
Let's swim to the island, find the treasure, and take what rightfully belongs to us.

PIRATE 1:
Aar.

PIRATE 2:
But we'll let him keep the parrot.

SCOUT (VOICE OVER):
The mean pirate took the treasure and went to hide it.
Meanwhile, the two nice pirates were in pursuit.

PIRATE 2:
Arr, I see him.
He went through the bushes, up the mountain, swam through the lake, and he's now burying the treasure on the other side of the island.

PIRATE 1:
Arr, you have excellent eyesight.

PIRATE 2:
Why, thank you.
Let's go.

SCOUT (VOICE OVER):
The mean pirate was about to bury his treasure when he heard a female voice cry out.

PRINCESS:
Help!
Help!
I am the princess of this island, and I've been trapped on this hill for so long!
Won't you help me down?

CAPTAIN:
No, I don't have time to help you.
I've got to hide me treasure.
Don't worry, Polly, she means nothing to me.
You're the only one I've ever loved.
    [Now, we'll] bury this treasure, and we'll be done with it.

PRINCESS:
Help!
Help!
I am the princess of this island, and I've been stranded on this hill for so long.

PIRATE 2:
Don't worry lassie, we'll help you.

PIRATE 1:
Here, let me help you down.

PRINCESS:
Thank you, you're both so brave and kind!
How can I reward you?

PIRATE 2:
Have you seen a mean pirate here with a treasure?

PRINCESS:
Ah, and a parrot that looks like it's sleeping on his shoulder that he talks to?
Why yes!
He went that way.
Let me show you.

SCOUT (VOICE OVER):
But just as the three were about to leave, the earth shook and rocks came falling down on them and buried them.

PIRATE 2:
The mean pirate must have made this avalanche to try to stop us.

PIRATE 1:
Hey, but he failed.
When he started the avalanche, the treasure must have fallen out of his hands because here he is.

PIRATE 2:
Arr.

PIRATE 1:
But where's the princess?

SCOUT (VOICE OVER):
The mean pirate had pulled the princess out of the rubble and kidnapped her.

CAPTAIN:
Oh they'll be back to try to save you, but I'll stop them and I'll get me treasure back.
And now, to take a nap.

PRINCESS:
Help!
Help!

SCOUT (VOICE OVER):
The good pirates freed the princess and escaped.

POLLY THE PARROT:
Squawk!
Oh, don't leave me here.
Take me with you.
Take me with you.

PIRATE 1:
*picks up parrot*

POLLY THE PARROT:
Oh, thank you.

SCOUT (VOICE OVER):
And when the mean pirate woke up, he was mad.

CAPTAIN:
Arr, me princess is gone, and, and me Polly is gone too!
And me treasure!
Oh, that's what I get for being so stingy.

SCOUT (VOICE OVER):
And so, the two good pirates sailed on to new adventures with the beautiful princess and Polly, who had been sleeping the whole time.
And as for the mean pirate, he's still on that island trying to find a way off, but at least he has a new pet.

CAPTAIN:
Don't climb upon me!
Speak to me.
I'm so lonely.

This is so embarrassing\dots
Wait, Miss [P], our school psychologist is getting up to speak!

MISS P:

So, I want everyone in the auditorium to take three deep breaths.
Everyone, *deep breathe*, ah.

One more?
*deep breathe*, ah.
All right, now let's continue.

PAUL (VOICE OVER):
Once upon a time, a little girl named Alice was sitting under a tree listening to her mother read a very boring story.
Suddenly she saw a big frog jumping in the grass, and Alice, being a curious girl, chased it into the forest.
Alice found herself deep in the forest.

ALICE:
Where am I, and where'd that frog go?
There he is!

PAUL (VOICE OVER):

A vampire, and a scary cat laughing at her.

ALICE:
I must get away!

PAUL (VOICE OVER):
Alice saw a door in a tree and went into the door.

ALICE:
Oh my it's spooky here.
I should have stayed with my mother.
Look, an exit - I'll go that way.

PAUL (VOICE OVER):
Alice found herself surrounded by living crayons.

ALICE:
Wow!
Living crayons!
Can you really color pictures?

BLUE CRAYON:
What a rude little girl, asking so many questions.
Of course we can color.
We can turn the sky from blue to black, and make little girls like you have spots on their head.

ALICE:
Oh no, you can't!
Oh no!
You take these spots back!

YELLOW CRAYON:
No.
Now we're gonna turn into curious green, just like that frog.
Hehehe!

ALICE:
There's that frog!
I'm gonna follow him, and maybe I can find my way back home.

PAUL (VOICE OVER):
And so Alice followed the frog through the forest, through the door.
And when she got up\dots

MOM:
And so that's the story of the curious girl.
Now wasn't that an exciting story?

Not nearly as exciting as what happened to me!
I chased a frog, it fell down a hole.
And then I hit my head.
And then I saw a laughing pumpkin.
Hu hu ho!
And then these mean, nasty crayons!t
