00:00:53.320 theater you've never seen a stage like
00:00:55.760 this
00:00:56.840 one anything can happen here
00:01:13.720 today we're going to watch the story of
00:01:15.600 Finn mol Ireland's most famous giant
00:01:19.159 we'll visit Finn's home on knockman hill
00:01:21.720 and watch as Finn and his wife una
00:01:23.960 prepare to do battle with the powerful
00:01:25.960 and terrifying giant cullin but before
00:01:29.040 we see the story let's share a few
00:01:31.200 moments with two of the musicians who
00:01:33.159 perform the music you'll be hearing in
00:01:34.799 the show the man playing the tin whistle
00:01:37.759 is an Irish musician named cathl
00:01:39.840 McConnell and the man playing the
00:01:41.840 accordion is Dave Richardson who comes
00:01:44.000 from England they both travel all over
00:01:46.640 the world performing with a group called
00:01:48.719 The Boys of the lock let's hear cathl
00:01:51.479 and Dave tell us more about their
00:01:53.799 music got my musical interest from my
00:01:56.320 father no doubt about that my father was
00:01:58.840 called Sandi McConnell he was a good
00:02:01.479 singer he played the whistle and in his
00:02:04.640 younger days he played the
00:02:06.560 accordion when um my father got me a
00:02:09.639 little tin whistle for Christmas it
00:02:12.599 seemed that the the whistle was the
00:02:14.239 right instrument for me to play if you
00:02:17.000 look at music in in any culture music is
00:02:20.000 a way of communication it's it's a way
00:02:22.319 of expressing ideas or
00:02:24.800 emotions and U lots of people like to
00:02:27.640 listen to music because it reflects
00:02:30.200 things that they feel or things that
00:02:31.920 they
00:02:32.550 [Music]
00:02:35.360 think if we look at Irish music as we
00:02:38.599 see it now or as we hear it it's been
00:02:41.319 handed down for hundreds of years and
00:02:44.239 it's still in very good
00:02:46.879 condition I think this is because people
00:02:49.720 in Ireland continue to live many of them
00:02:52.280 in the country and the old way survive
00:02:54.319 the old ways of meeting with one another
00:02:56.680 and talking to one another playing music
00:02:59.360 together
00:02:59.960 [Music]
00:03:04.580 [Laughter]
00:03:07.770 [Music]
00:03:12.440 I first heard a story of Finn mul from
00:03:14.760 my
00:03:16.799 mother it's a dramatic sort of
00:03:19.799 story it's a story of the impending
00:03:22.400 Battle of the two
00:03:24.319 giants it's a bit of a challenge um put
00:03:27.879 music to a story cuz you really have to
00:03:30.879 think about
00:03:32.720 it we tried to decide what kind of music
00:03:36.680 would fit these characters to support
00:03:39.080 the the story that was being
00:03:42.480 told we think about the bad guy kulan
00:03:45.959 and we think of dark heavy Sinister
00:03:49.879 music for him and and we thought of
00:03:52.360 maybe using very low notes on the
00:03:55.640 instruments we used a little instrument
00:03:58.079 called nordon and used the bass on
00:04:00.760 it he looks dark menacing you wouldn't
00:04:04.079 want him coming to your birthday party
00:04:05.840 he's the guy who'd steal all the
00:04:09.720 cookies for Finn we wanted something a
00:04:12.239 bit more light and
00:04:14.319 comical he looks like he'd be a lot of
00:04:16.680 fun and uh at the same time he doesn't
00:04:19.279 look too street smart I think he misses
00:04:21.279 one or two things in
00:04:24.240 life so we decided to use lighter
00:04:27.120 instruments like the 10 whistle
00:04:35.360 the wife of Finn unaa is a very good
00:04:37.919 friend to Finn she's his best friend
00:04:39.960 that's why he married her she's a very
00:04:42.320 busy woman active happy she's very
00:04:46.120 content so we chose light instruments
00:04:49.759 and very light rhythms like The Jig and
00:04:52.160 the
00:04:55.560 poker this business of riding Tunes is
00:04:58.680 unusual you don't have you take out a
00:05:00.320 pen and paper and write them you sit
00:05:02.280 with an instrument in your hand and your
00:05:04.680 fingers on the instrument and you move
00:05:06.600 your fingers
00:05:08.160 around and suddenly a little piece of
00:05:10.680 Melody catches your ear and you think I
00:05:13.240 like that that's the start of an
00:05:15.720 idea and then it might all click
00:05:19.160 together you know it's just like making
00:05:20.680 up a little poem or
00:05:23.880 something playing this music gives a lot
00:05:26.520 of pleasure to a lot of
00:05:28.639 people
00:05:30.160 as time goes on it's it's being played
00:05:32.880 more and more there are an awful lot of
00:05:35.479 young people learning this music now
00:05:38.479 much more so than when I was
00:05:41.520 young it's very interesting to to think
00:05:44.360 about what we get from music as people I
00:05:47.360 think it reminds us of how much like
00:05:49.360 other people we are they can be people
00:05:51.560 in other countries in the world or they
00:05:53.199 can be people who lived in the
00:05:55.800 past they can play you a tune or sing
00:05:58.400 you a song that you hear a melody and
00:06:01.520 you know that they're the same kind of
00:06:03.400 person as
00:06:05.919 you and now here come the sounds and
00:06:09.120 sights of Finn
00:06:16.490 [Music]
00:06:28.560 mul
00:06:29.870 [Music]
00:06:31.410 [Applause]
00:06:32.790 [Music]
00:06:40.930 [Applause]
00:06:43.640 [Music]
00:06:58.520 the
00:07:01.620 [Music]
00:07:27.960 Finn mul was the most famous Champion
00:07:30.520 Ireland ever
00:07:31.890 [Music]
00:07:34.240 knew Finn was a giant to be sure but
00:07:37.240 when he was born he was no bigger than a
00:07:39.479 fire breathing
00:07:43.879 dragon and as Giants went in those days
00:07:46.639 that was a might on the Wii
00:07:53.840 side now King cool was Finn's father and
00:07:57.440 being a famous Irish giant himself he
00:07:59.879 took the lad's small size to
00:08:03.000 heart I have a boil on me flank that's
00:08:06.280 bigger than he is said King cool on
00:08:09.319 seeing the boy for the first time King
00:08:12.159 cool was so distraught over Finn's size
00:08:14.039 that he took the child to the castle
00:08:15.479 parapet wiped the potato sized tears
00:08:17.759 from his eyes and gently punted him into
00:08:20.560 the lock
00:08:21.560 below now the grandmother of the lad
00:08:24.120 King Cool's mother just happened to be
00:08:26.080 on the shore watching as the infant
00:08:27.759 plunged into the water
00:08:30.159 why that's me own flesh and blood
00:08:32.200 splashing about there she said and
00:08:35.080 immediately dove
00:08:38.360 in in two shakes of a lamb's tail she
00:08:40.958 dragged the child out of the lock and
00:08:42.719 rushed away with him deep into the
00:08:45.600 woods finding a nice Stout tree the
00:08:48.279 Grand Dame took out her Hatchet and
00:08:50.080 chopped a chamber within
00:08:52.360 it and there the two of them
00:08:58.440 lived
00:09:02.399 for years the old woman lovingly fed fin
00:09:04.839 a diet of tree bark Pete and the
00:09:07.000 occasional
00:09:08.839 grub but the child thrived
00:09:16.839 nonetheless after some time the boy
00:09:19.000 rather outgrew his surroundings and it
00:09:21.160 was then that his grandmother knew it
00:09:22.600 was time to send them out into the wild
00:09:24.640 and cruel
00:09:26.320 world now such an inauspicious beginning
00:09:28.760 to a life as been known to spoil a man's
00:09:30.600 disposition entirely but not young finin
00:09:34.240 he thanked his grandmother for looking
00:09:35.760 after him kissed her gently upon the
00:09:37.959 head and set out to distinguish himself
00:09:40.480 as a Great
00:09:44.480 Hero why he was as strong as two dozen
00:09:48.079 oxen and as Swift as 43
00:09:52.800 hairs and he Tred all over the emerald
00:09:55.760 Countryside taking a glen at a step I
00:09:59.519 Hiller a
00:10:00.519 leap and locks had
00:10:07.279 abound before too long Finn took a wife
00:10:09.920 for himself and her name was Uno Uno was
00:10:12.959 a beauty as they say and a giant as
00:10:15.120 herself I and that sun-kissed lass was a
00:10:17.800 clever one too they were a matched pair
00:10:20.160 they were with Finn's Braun and Uno's
00:10:23.079 brain together they lived quite happily
00:10:25.279 upon the top of knck mini Hill in oler
00:10:28.200 people always wondered why it was was
00:10:29.480 that Finn had selected such a windy spot
00:10:31.279 for his dwelling now Finn made his share
00:10:34.120 of excuses for choosing to live in the
00:10:35.839 middle of nowhere but the real reason
00:10:38.079 Finn made his home a top knock Min was
00:10:40.360 to see cullin
00:10:42.880 coming oh
00:10:45.639 kolin it sends shivers down me spine to
00:10:49.360 even utter the name
00:10:54.320 cin no other Giant in all of ir could
00:10:57.040 stand before
00:10:58.240 him
00:10:59.959 it was said and I personally know for a
00:11:02.120 fact is true that by a single blow of
00:11:04.639 his fist he once flattened a thunderbolt
00:11:07.279 into the shape of a
00:11:09.920 pancake he always carried it about with
00:11:12.040 him in his pocket and before he got into
00:11:14.639 a fight with one of his foes cullin
00:11:16.600 would show them the pancake just to give
00:11:19.079 them a notion of the kind of pulpin
00:11:20.639 they're about to
00:11:24.760 receive kullin had given every Giant and
00:11:27.320 I a considerable taring every one of
00:11:29.600 course but Finn himself but that was
00:11:32.120 only own to the fact that whenever
00:11:33.560 kullin went after Finn our hero would
00:11:35.720 run in the opposite
00:11:41.399 direction now at this Time Finn was
00:11:43.480 build in the causeway from Ireland to
00:11:45.440 Scotland it was a grand undertaking even
00:11:48.399 for Finn so he had his band of Champions
00:11:50.760 called the fenians assisting him one day
00:11:53.839 down at the causeway Finn and his men
00:11:55.480 were rearranging the coast and and
00:11:57.320 moving a few small cliffs when he began
00:11:59.760 gnawn upon his
00:12:01.200 [Music]
00:12:02.959 thumb you see this is how Finn called
00:12:05.880 upon his singular gift for
00:12:08.360 prophecy whenever he got into a fix and
00:12:10.760 he couldn't fathom the choices that life
00:12:12.399 so often presents he would sock his
00:12:14.360 thumb for inspiration and a most curious
00:12:16.720 thing would occur he would see the
00:12:18.560 future before him as clear as
00:12:20.730 [Music]
00:12:22.680 day for it was in his thumb that his
00:12:25.000 power for prophecy
00:12:27.480 resided now at that precise moment Finn
00:12:30.480 had divined from his thumb that kullin
00:12:32.920 was coming to the causeway to do battle
00:12:34.880 with him and it was just then that Finn
00:12:38.160 discovered a very warm and sudden fit of
00:12:40.959 affection for his
00:12:44.480 wife I need to see me lovea said Finn my
00:12:49.120 th tells me so me think she's in
00:12:53.040 danger but Finn pleaded Conan the bald
00:12:55.880 one of the fenians what about the Co Way
00:12:59.440 alas it was no use Finn was already well
00:13:01.760 on his way to knock
00:13:07.560 Min God save all
00:13:10.800 here Musha Finn said his wife welcome
00:13:14.519 home to your owna you darling
00:13:17.040 bully and what brought you home so soon
00:13:22.160 Finn why me Sweet Rose nothing but the
00:13:25.360 purest of love and affection for ye of
00:13:28.120 course
00:13:30.120 after Finn spoke he clapped his thumb
00:13:31.839 into his mouth Finn sweetness said Uno
00:13:35.800 please don't do that while you're
00:13:37.120 talking to me it's not polite he's a
00:13:40.240 coming said Finn I see him below D Ganon
00:13:46.240 who's coming said Uno who are you
00:13:48.000 talking about it's that nasty Coolin it
00:13:52.920 is oh it's said that when he gets angry
00:13:55.959 and begins to stamp a dozen earthquakes
00:13:58.199 erupt and when he does battle with
00:14:00.199 Thunderbolts he flattens them into tiny
00:14:02.600 pancakes and then eats them with honey a
00:14:05.600 whole Hive of it and with a Bees Still
00:14:08.440 buoen inside it gracious The Brute said
00:14:12.600 Uno I don't know how I'll manage if I
00:14:15.800 run away again I'll be disgraced before
00:14:17.880 me people and my thumb tells me that I
00:14:20.279 must meet him sooner or later well my
00:14:23.279 bully don't be downcast said Uno leave
00:14:25.920 it to me and I'll bring you out of this
00:14:27.519 scrape better than you might on your
00:14:29.759 own now it so happened that Uno had a
00:14:32.560 sister named granua who lived upon a
00:14:34.639 Hill Called calore just opposite NOC
00:14:36.639 Manny the beautiful Valley that
00:14:38.560 separated the two sisters was only four
00:14:40.600 miles wide and so on a summer's evening
00:14:42.720 when they wanted to talk Uno and Grano
00:14:44.920 only had to put their heads out the
00:14:46.240 windows of their homes granua are you
00:14:49.040 home said unaa I am sister dear said
00:14:52.800 granua and how have you been today well
00:14:56.079 not so well I'm afraid said Uno would
00:14:59.199 you do us the favor of looking about
00:15:00.560 from your window and telling us what you
00:15:03.120 see well nothing sister dear it's only a
00:15:06.399 mountain coming over this way said
00:15:08.440 granua nothing to trouble yourselves
00:15:11.000 over a mountain that's no mountain said
00:15:14.839 Uno that's the Giant cullin and he's
00:15:17.279 coming to leather our
00:15:18.959 fin perhaps if you delay The Brute it'll
00:15:21.399 give me a moment to think why don't you
00:15:23.279 ask him up for a bite I only have 50 of
00:15:27.040 butter that's not nearly enough to make
00:15:29.120 cake for that giant said granua if you
00:15:31.959 TST me over a ton or two you'll oblige
00:15:34.519 me very
00:15:35.680 much so Uno got the largest tub of
00:15:38.399 butter she had and called up to her
00:15:40.319 sister granua are you ready said Uno I'm
00:15:44.279 going to throw
00:15:47.319 now Uno gave the butter a mighty heave
00:15:50.560 but in her anxiety over kullin she
00:15:52.360 forgot to say the magic words that were
00:15:53.959 to make it fly to
00:15:56.519 granua and so the butter landed with a
00:15:59.480 thud halfway between the two
00:16:01.260 [Music]
00:16:02.720 hills my curse upon you baleful butter
00:16:06.000 cried Uno you've disgraced
00:16:09.560 me and with that said the butter turned
00:16:12.000 instantly to Stone it lies there today
00:16:14.440 exactly as it came out of una's hand
00:16:16.440 with a mark of her four fingers and
00:16:18.000 thumb imprinted upon
00:16:22.399 it oh never mind said Gran I'll do the
00:16:26.120 best I can to stall
00:16:27.920 cullin
00:16:29.800 so granua baked her cake anyway and
00:16:31.920 signal kullin to come up to
00:16:35.040 colore she placed the cake before the
00:16:37.360 Giant and without so much as a thanky
00:16:39.920 Miss kullan threw it into his mouth and
00:16:42.600 devoured it in one frightening
00:16:45.079 bite needs butter he grunted licking the
00:16:48.800 last Crumbs from his fingers and
00:16:50.519 proceeded on his
00:16:53.040 way in the meantime Finn was in quite a
00:16:55.959 panic on KN mini unaa can you do nothing
00:16:58.920 for me where's all your invention woman
00:17:01.920 will I be sked like a rabbit before your
00:17:03.959 eyes and have me named as Christ forever
00:17:06.160 before all of Ireland how can I fight a
00:17:09.039 man who scares the fire out of
00:17:11.359 thunderbolts there now be easy Finn
00:17:14.199 replied Uno I've got an idea just leave
00:17:17.400 it to
00:17:18.720 me with that Uno went to
00:17:21.589 [Music]
00:17:24.240 work first she rumed about and found 21
00:17:27.160 iron griddles
00:17:29.100 [Music]
00:17:30.960 then she took the griddles and kneaded
00:17:32.400 them into the middle of six loaves of
00:17:36.400 bread she then baked the Loaves on the
00:17:38.679 fire setting them aside in the cupboard
00:17:40.520 when they were
00:17:42.440 done finally Uno took a large pot of new
00:17:45.440 milk which she made into Kurds and Whey
00:17:47.880 and then whispered something into Finn's
00:17:52.039 ear and just as culin was coming across
00:17:54.960 the valley Uno fetched a baby's cradle
00:17:57.480 and instructed Finn to lie down down in
00:17:59.159 it say nothing and follow me
00:18:01.960 lead I will but I don't like it one bit
00:18:06.360 just as he was getting settled kullin
00:18:08.320 burst through the
00:18:11.559 door be this the home of the great
00:18:15.000 finm he asked I it is indeed said Uno
00:18:19.280 but he's not in at the moment someone
00:18:21.440 told him that a big bassoon of a giant
00:18:23.400 called cullin was down at the causeway
00:18:25.200 looking for him so he rushed away to
00:18:27.440 catch him can I helpy I am cin said he
00:18:32.559 looking puzzled and I've been after your
00:18:35.960 husband for 12 months unar let out a
00:18:39.640 loud mocking
00:18:41.460 [Laughter]
00:18:43.080 laugh and looked at him as if he was
00:18:45.400 only a little Pip of a man if you take
00:18:48.200 my advice you poor looking creature
00:18:50.159 you'll pray day and night that you may
00:18:51.559 never see him said Uno it'll be a black
00:18:54.400 day for you if you
00:18:57.240 do snorted cullin dismissing Uno's
00:19:01.440 warning ah now the wind's blown against
00:19:04.280 the DAR said Uno see you as how Finn is
00:19:07.480 away from home would you be civil enough
00:19:09.559 to turn the house
00:19:13.200 around no this request took kolan back
00:19:16.799 for even he didn't do this sort of task
00:19:18.720 on a daily
00:19:20.320 basis nevertheless he pulled the little
00:19:22.480 finger of his right hand three times and
00:19:24.280 went
00:19:26.520 outside he then put his massive arm arms
00:19:28.960 about the house and with some effort
00:19:31.120 turned it in a position favorable to the
00:19:34.679 wind thanky kindly said Uno please stay
00:19:39.080 and have a bit of me humble Fair even
00:19:41.200 though you and Finn are enemies he would
00:19:42.840 scorn me if I didn't treat you kindly in
00:19:44.720 his own home unar brought kullin to the
00:19:47.799 table and placed before him the half
00:19:49.880 dozen loaves of bread she had baked
00:19:51.799 together with 10 sides of bacon and a
00:19:53.919 stack of steam and
00:19:55.520 cabbage kullin greedily stuffed one of
00:19:58.080 the loaves into his mouth and took a
00:19:59.600 tremendous bite when Cullen's teeth
00:20:02.120 struck The Griddle that lay in the
00:20:03.480 middle of the loaf the entire house
00:20:06.000 shook
00:20:07.840 oh blood and fury shouted kolan and just
00:20:13.400 what sort of bread is this you've given
00:20:15.600 me I might ask what's the matter said
00:20:18.960 Uno matter shouted kullin why what's the
00:20:22.880 matter indeed here the two best teeth in
00:20:25.480 me head smashed to
00:20:27.400 smin oh it's a Pity that I forgot to
00:20:29.840 tell you that nobody but Finn himself
00:20:31.600 can eat it and his little M who sleeps
00:20:33.600 in the Cradle over there take your bread
00:20:36.520 away I'll not have another tooth in my
00:20:39.280 head now now said Uno don't be waken the
00:20:42.760 child with all your belly aching then
00:20:45.600 Finn gave a shriek that startled the
00:20:51.480 Giant now you've gone and done it you've
00:20:53.720 awakened him said
00:20:56.640 Uno said he I'm hungry and I want
00:20:59.840 something to eat Uno went to the cradle
00:21:02.720 and gave Finn one of the loaves of bread
00:21:04.720 that had no griddle in it after a few
00:21:07.440 bites he realized it was safe and made
00:21:09.440 the rest of the loaf disappear in two
00:21:11.880 bites cullin was thunderstuck and by the
00:21:15.240 look on his face Uno knew her plan was
00:21:18.039 working I'd like to have a look at the
00:21:20.279 lad in the Cradle said kolan any child
00:21:23.360 who can manage that bird isn't good
00:21:25.039 fighting
00:21:26.039 trim get up and say hello to Our Guest
00:21:28.679 me Lan said Uno motioning to Finn it's
00:21:31.880 terribly shy when company comes not many
00:21:34.159 Travelers get up our way you know Finn
00:21:36.760 crawled out of the cradle and toddled
00:21:38.320 over to cullan are you strong as Mida
00:21:42.720 what a boom voice and such a young babe
00:21:46.279 just a touch of the whooping cough Uno
00:21:48.520 explained with a smile then Finn grabbed
00:21:51.039 a white stone and handed it to
00:21:52.840 cin can you squeeze water out of this
00:21:55.600 white stone said Finn
00:21:58.530 [Music]
00:22:01.279 Naka colan was puzzled but as he
00:22:04.039 intended to humor the lad he took the
00:22:05.799 stone and squeezed it as hard as he
00:22:07.840 could but it was no use he might be able
00:22:11.520 to turn the house around or flatten a
00:22:13.600 thunderbolt into a pancake but squeezing
00:22:15.919 water out of a rock was something else
00:22:18.799 entirely you call yourself a giant mear
00:22:22.760 can do it and he showed me how give me
00:22:25.600 that stone Finn took the Stone from
00:22:28.600 Cullen and then slightly exchanged it
00:22:30.960 with the CDs just as Uno had
00:22:34.400 instructed and he then squeezed the
00:22:36.720 curds until the way squirted out in a
00:22:39.320 little shower from his hand clear as
00:22:43.200 water I don't care to waste my time with
00:22:46.039 the giant the likes of you you'd better
00:22:48.919 be out of here before M Dog comes back
00:22:50.840 or else he'll make porridge of you and
00:22:52.520 serve you for dinner now kullin was
00:22:55.559 taken quite a back he's a lucky man to
00:22:58.320 be sure to have such a handsome wife and
00:23:01.159 a son who snacks on iron and squeezes
00:23:03.840 water from dry Stones I see I have
00:23:07.120 misjudged him terribly if it's all the
00:23:10.039 same to ye I think I'll stay a bit for
00:23:12.240 Finn's return it would do me proud to
00:23:14.880 make the acquaintance of a Great Hero
00:23:16.440 such as he and I shall have to apologize
00:23:18.880 for chasing him hither and Yonder for
00:23:20.720 all these months yes apologize I must
00:23:24.520 even if it takes Finn a fart night to
00:23:27.440 return
00:23:32.640 with that cullan sat next to Finn's
00:23:34.480 cradle and rocked it somewhat roughly as
00:23:36.919 Giants will do and hummed a soothing
00:23:39.400 giant
00:23:44.760 lullabi poor Finn saw his very life pass
00:23:48.240 before his
00:23:50.400 eyes oh me bones what is wrong with the
00:23:55.159 child asked kullin um uh
00:23:58.960 the poor lad is teething said Uno his
00:24:01.360 gums have been smarting lately there's
00:24:03.120 nothing that can be done I'm not so sure
00:24:06.480 that said cullin me own dear mother had
00:24:09.480 a little trick she used when me Choppers
00:24:11.720 come up with that cullin reached for the
00:24:14.600 flask of spirits he kept in his hip
00:24:16.440 pocket he poured a touch upon the little
00:24:18.919 finger of his right hand and opened
00:24:20.919 Finn's mouth with his left then he
00:24:23.400 massaged Finn's gums with a spirit
00:24:25.360 soaked finger the spirits will dull the
00:24:27.880 boy's pain
00:24:29.039 said he now it was bad enough to have
00:24:31.480 cullin in one's house but to sit back
00:24:33.679 and take his little finger in the mouth
00:24:35.240 was
00:24:36.080 unpardonable now just a little bit more
00:24:39.080 laddy ah said cullin as he lovingly
00:24:43.240 administered another dose you know Mrs
00:24:46.720 mul I think after I've made your
00:24:49.120 husband's acquaintance I will take a
00:24:51.600 wife so the I may have a son just like
00:24:55.679 yours it's the teeth way in the back of
00:24:58.000 his mouth that are the worst said Uno
00:25:00.799 you're such a help kind man and at that
00:25:04.200 moment Uno decided to take matters into
00:25:06.760 her own
00:25:10.399 hands she grabbed the pot that hung in
00:25:12.640 the Hearth and rearing back she hurled
00:25:14.720 it at the head of the joyant with all
00:25:16.159 her
00:25:17.480 might instead of cullin however the pot
00:25:20.480 struck poor Finn dead upon the
00:25:23.159 crown the concussion was so great that
00:25:26.039 Finn clamped down upon Ken's little
00:25:28.480 finger which was still applying the
00:25:30.240 spirits lopping it off at the third
00:25:33.150 [Music]
00:25:35.760 knuckle look what the boy has done to me
00:25:38.880 kullin groaned holding his maimed right
00:25:41.559 hand I'm
00:25:47.520 finished you see the Giant's huge
00:25:49.720 strength all lay in the very little
00:25:51.399 finger of his right hand which Finn had
00:25:54.159 accidentally separated from its Master
00:25:57.559 kullin then let loose with another ear
00:25:59.600 shattering scream then right before the
00:26:02.080 eyes of Finn and Uno he shrunk from the
00:26:04.799 size of a giant to that of a timid
00:26:06.919 little church
00:26:08.520 [Music]
00:26:15.960 mouse now Uno and Finn had a large ton
00:26:18.880 cat who liked to sleep behind the stove
00:26:21.039 but all the commotion woke him and when
00:26:22.799 he came out to investigate there stood
00:26:24.559 the oddest looking Mouse he had ever
00:26:27.240 seen
00:26:29.640 without Much Ado the Tom cat chased the
00:26:31.720 scream and former giant down knock many
00:26:34.000 around the locks and across the fields
00:26:36.279 right into the
00:26:42.520 sea glory be said Finn in Triumph there
00:26:47.320 isn't a giant in all of a as great as
00:26:50.240 myself I have defeated the great
00:26:53.720 kullan Uno picked up her newly dented
00:26:56.360 pot and gazed meaningfully into your
00:26:58.440 dear husband's
00:27:00.600 eyes uh or perhaps should I say we have
00:27:05.080 defeated the great
00:27:06.600 kol and truer words were never
00:27:10.260 [Music]
00:27:27.159 spoken





00:30:23.600 come on
00:30:25.120 in settle back it's curtain time at the
00:30:29.640 story lane theater you've never seen a
00:30:32.799 stage like this
00:30:34.440 one anything can happen
00:30:50.240 here today we're going to hear about a
00:30:52.760 legend the legend of John Henry the
00:30:56.360 story of this steel drive and man has
00:30:58.440 been passed down mainly in a song the
00:31:01.399 song has been around for over a hundred
00:31:03.440 years and it changes a little every time
00:31:05.960 someone new sings it but it's always
00:31:08.399 about a remarkably strong man and his
00:31:11.000 race against a machine we are going to
00:31:13.760 hear two versions of that song Today
00:31:16.240 performed in the style of music known as
00:31:18.559 the blues one from a musician named BB
00:31:21.559 King and the other from the man who's
00:31:23.639 playing the music you're hearing right
00:31:25.360 now Taj Mahal Taj has been playing the
00:31:29.039 blues for practically his whole life
00:31:31.720 let's hear what he has to say about his
00:31:33.559 music and the legend of John Henry the
00:31:37.360 blues can express many moods and
00:31:41.039 feelings 360° of emotion Joy sadness fun
00:31:47.240 laughter all kinds of
00:31:51.320 things it has the ability to take
00:31:54.159 whatever life is and present it in a way
00:31:57.480 that you hear it right
00:32:00.960 away there are some songs that came out
00:32:03.279 of railroad work that was a a a really
00:32:07.519 hard job you think about you think about
00:32:10.039 laying railroad track and ties and that
00:32:13.360 they used to do all that work by hand
00:32:15.679 that was all done by
00:32:17.880 hand chanting rhythmically while you're
00:32:20.880 doing that kind of work makes it Go
00:32:22.760 easier the sun was hot the work had to
00:32:25.440 be done and the freedom that they had
00:32:28.080 was to rhythmically deal with this
00:32:30.600 that's something that they could do so
00:32:32.039 they sang their songs and the work goes
00:32:34.080 much
00:32:35.880 easier the first time I heard the legend
00:32:38.159 of John Henry I cannot even recall it
00:32:40.480 was so long ago that I know it was
00:32:43.200 before the age of five that much I can
00:32:45.720 tell you but it came out of the folklore
00:32:48.639 that was always being brought down the
00:32:50.159 line and that was one of the reasons why
00:32:51.600 I wanted to play that song it's a very
00:32:53.039 important
00:32:55.960 song when John Henry red was a baby
00:33:01.279 boy sitting on his dad's
00:33:05.880 knee daddy say son son son keep on
00:33:09.720 looking to the sun don't you ever take
00:33:12.880 no pattern after
00:33:15.480 me don't you never take no pattern after
00:33:21.200 me John Henry actually takes an incident
00:33:24.639 that happened out near Beckley West
00:33:26.399 Virginia around the building of the big
00:33:28.679 Benin tunnel for the Chesapeake and Ohio
00:33:33.720 Railroad there was a race to see whether
00:33:36.080 the man would hold up as good as the
00:33:37.480 steam
00:33:39.460 [Music]
00:33:42.760 drill said to the
00:33:46.159 stream steam I'm going run you

00:33:55.360 down more you go watch me throw
00:34:00.080 down more watch meow
00:34:05.360 down John Henry is the struggle between
00:34:09.239 humans and the Machine there's always
00:34:12.119 the desire to show that the human touch
00:34:14.760 is more important than the mechanical
00:34:18.110 [Music]
00:34:25.960 touch John Henry
00:34:28.520 hammered in the
00:34:30.760 mountains to the head of his hammer C

00:34:44.750 [Music]
00:34:46.199 water
00:34:51.000 drink
00:34:55.000 drink Legends started out because of
00:34:58.000 people's desire to have
00:35:00.040 hope it usually is some sort of unique
00:35:02.680 incident that happens and then a lot of
00:35:05.560 different
00:35:06.480 people put their own little spin on it
00:35:09.720 in my opinion what John Henry symbolized
00:35:12.440 was uh endurance and strength to really
00:35:15.040 come up against a a formidable a very
00:35:18.400 formidable uh fall and
00:35:22.359 Triumph thanks Taj for playing your
00:35:24.880 version of the song and now let's let's
00:35:27.839 get ready to see the legend of John
00:35:30.160 Henry be sure to listen for another
00:35:32.520 version of the John Henry song by BB
00:35:34.680 King and you'll see how the legend of
00:35:37.200 John Henry keeps right on growing all
00:35:39.800 the
00:35:41.470 [Music]
00:35:56.640 time
00:35:58.359 yeah my name John Henry and I'm a
00:36:01.760 natural man but I was born one morning
00:36:05.160 with the hammer in my hand and if one
00:36:08.280 day I find myself out all alone I'll
00:36:12.000 hammer till the evening and found my way
00:36:14.960 back home and found my way back home and
00:36:18.400 found my way back home and found my way
00:36:21.319 back
00:36:22.660 [Music]
00:36:26.560 home
00:36:29.920 [Music]
00:36:43.760 way back a good while
00:36:46.359 ago when the United States was still
00:36:48.880 busting out of his baby shoes there
00:36:51.640 lived a man named John
00:36:56.520 Henry now ain't no history books going
00:36:59.240 to tell you about John Henry cuz he was
00:37:01.800 just too plain big for them books but
00:37:05.400 when it comes right down to it John
00:37:07.800 Henry was the mightiest dog gone
00:37:10.319 greatest nation Builder this country's
00:37:12.480 ever
00:37:14.200 seen oh sure you had your Washingtons
00:37:17.319 and your Jeffersons but they was just
00:37:20.079 Presidents you see John Henry was a
00:37:23.200 steel driving
00:37:26.520 man
00:37:29.240 now some folks think they know all about
00:37:31.280 John Henry and his famous race with the
00:37:33.319 steam drill but most of them don't even
00:37:35.720 know a steel steak from a beef
00:37:38.319 steak see I was around when John Henry
00:37:41.079 was King of the railroad camps and I
00:37:43.240 remember him just as clear as the
00:37:45.280 Kentucky moon on an August night so
00:37:47.920 y'all listen up cuz I'm going to tell
00:37:49.720 you the guaranteed goldplated
00:37:53.720 99.9% truth about John
00:37:56.440 Henry
00:37:58.880 now it all started in a little village
00:38:01.200 way down south in Cotton country mama
00:38:05.079 and papa Henry were just your ordinary
00:38:06.960 sharecropping folk no different from the
00:38:09.200 rest of us they lived in a log cabin and
00:38:12.200 one Springtime morning Mama Henry gave
00:38:15.119 birth to a baby named John
00:38:17.599 Henry now folks knew right away there
00:38:19.880 was something different about John Henry
00:38:22.560 shoot Ain't No Ordinary baby born with a
00:38:24.720 hammer in his hand and ain't no ordinary
00:38:27.520 baby weighs over 45 lbs but John Henry
00:38:32.000 did and that wasn't even the strange
00:38:33.960 part not two hours out of his mama's
00:38:37.160 belly John Henry ups and starts talking
00:38:41.280 oh if it ain't too much trouble he said
00:38:43.000 just as sweet as sugar would y'all mind
00:38:46.040 bringing me something to eat I'm Mighty
00:38:49.040 hungry now nobody ever heard a 2hour old
00:38:52.480 baby talking before but after a while
00:38:55.920 Mama Henry asked John Henry what he
00:38:57.720 wanted to
00:38:58.800 eat well he said figuring and
00:39:01.480 calculating on his fingers I'd like
00:39:04.400 eight ham bones uh two pots of blacke
00:39:08.160 peas a three foot slab of cornbread
00:39:12.119 three kettles of cabbage soup a big heap
00:39:15.560 of colled greens four pans of peach
00:39:18.280 cobbler and and two pots of coffee
00:39:21.240 strong coffee uh that is if it ain't too
00:39:24.160 much bother so John Henry ate pretty
00:39:27.160 good
00:39:28.240 and he was so tuckered out when he was
00:39:30.040 done by Jiminy he slept for a solid
00:39:37.240 week well the years went by and John
00:39:40.280 Henry grew
00:39:41.390 [Music]
00:39:43.079 bigger at 2 years old he was juggling
00:39:45.839 chickens for fun at 6 he was wrestling
00:39:49.200 with razorback hogs and juggling
00:39:51.040 chickens at the same
00:39:52.610 [Music]
00:39:55.520 time and at 10 why at 10 John Henry was
00:40:00.319 already a
00:40:01.570 [Music]
00:40:03.560 teenager but there was nothing in the
00:40:05.960 whole wide world that John Henry liked
00:40:08.280 more than swinging a hammer and singing
00:40:10.599 a
00:40:11.340 [Music]
00:40:13.720 song he'd Hammer Hickory Sticks he'd
00:40:16.720 Hammer fence post cooking pots brass
00:40:19.760 Nails Boulders anything he could get his
00:40:23.160 hands
00:40:25.520 on he'd pound in the morning clanging
00:40:28.359 the
00:40:29.920 evening his arms grew as solid as Oak
00:40:33.079 stumps and his chest busted out bigger
00:40:35.839 than a
00:40:37.680 barrel while he grew so big that one day
00:40:40.880 he couldn't even fit through the front
00:40:42.440 door of his parents
00:40:44.010 [Music]
00:40:47.800 cabin and that's when John Henry decided
00:40:50.480 it was time to leave
00:40:52.920 home mama he said one morning I'm a man
00:40:56.960 now
00:40:57.880 I'm a natural man and I'm going to find
00:41:00.599 me a job with a hammer in my
00:41:03.330 [Music]
00:41:06.359 hand so John Henry left home and he
00:41:09.839 walked North through the
00:41:12.150 [Music]
00:41:14.839 countryside and as the sun went down at
00:41:17.400 night making the whole land light up
00:41:19.960 like fire he sang a song to himself yeah
00:41:24.040 my name's John Henry and I'm a a man I
00:41:28.720 was Bor one morning with the hammer in
00:41:31.880 my hand and every one day I find myself
00:41:35.880 out all alone I'll hammer till the
00:41:39.040 evening found my way back home found my
00:41:42.839 way back
00:41:43.920 home my way back
00:41:46.119 home my way back home one afternoon
00:41:49.079 while he was walking in The Lonesome
00:41:50.599 Woods he stumbled across a road of iron
00:41:53.720 rails those rails sparkled in the
00:41:56.280 sunshine like silver
00:41:57.800 over and beneath them was freshly cut
00:42:00.480 wood ties which smelled sweeter than a
00:42:03.359 bag of
00:42:08.119 balsom and John Henry exclaimed to no
00:42:10.599 one in particular by Jiminy if this
00:42:13.440 ain't a railroad track then I'm an ox
00:42:15.560 and a both at the same
00:42:21.119 time now John Henry who was no ox and
00:42:24.000 certainly no was correct in his
00:42:26.520 assessment
00:42:27.920 he had in fact stumbled onto the great
00:42:29.680 chest peak in Ohio railroad line which
00:42:32.280 was just being built around that
00:42:34.880 time the CNO line as people like to call
00:42:37.920 it was going to connect up the Eastern
00:42:40.559 with the midwestern part of the United
00:42:43.250 [Music]
00:42:45.000 States the railroad cut through some of
00:42:47.559 the deepest darkest most howling
00:42:50.040 Wilderness of West virginy along Hills
00:42:52.839 and hollas up mountains and down valleys
00:42:56.440 through Woods as thick as a corn feeli
00:42:58.640 in cutting
00:43:03.640 time well John Henry knew right away he
00:43:06.280 was on something big and after a day of
00:43:09.000 following those rails he reached the top
00:43:10.880 of a
00:43:12.839 rise and from that rise he saw where the
00:43:16.000 tracks ended far in the valley and a
00:43:19.319 whole assembly of men were living and
00:43:23.920 working from up there he could hear the
00:43:26.680 clang and clink of hammers hidden steel
00:43:29.240 stakes and to John Henry it was The
00:43:32.079 Sound Of Heaven
00:43:33.599 itself a beautiful Harmony of hammers
00:43:36.280 ringing over the hills like like song
00:43:38.640 birds in early
00:43:41.000 spring now that's a job for me John
00:43:44.119 Henry yelled beaming from ear to ear a
00:43:47.079 job for a natural man who wants to build
00:43:50.160 this land with a hammer in his hand with
00:43:53.480 that John Henry scrambled down that rise
00:43:56.079 as fast as his feet take him and when he
00:43:58.480 got to Camp he was
00:44:00.960 [Music]
00:44:03.200 amazed it was like nothing he had ever
00:44:05.760 seen
00:44:06.540 [Music]
00:44:08.480 before there were men from all over the
00:44:11.400 world working together with
00:44:14.280 hammers there were black men and brown
00:44:16.920 men and red men there were yellow men
00:44:19.520 and white men
00:44:23.559 too so when John Henry got to Camp he
00:44:26.559 just p his way straight ahead to the end
00:44:28.599 of the line picked up a 9B hammer and
00:44:31.240 started driving steel Stakes like it was
00:44:33.440 going out of style clang HD here Bang
00:44:37.480 hdden there ding hitting this one dang
00:44:41.000 hitting that
00:44:43.720 one well after a while everyone on that
00:44:46.400 line stopped what they was doing and
00:44:48.559 started looking at this rather large
00:44:50.440 enthusiastic
00:44:52.800 stranger they saw right away that John
00:44:55.599 Henry was just a natural EST man they
00:44:57.839 had ever laid eyes on why he hammered
00:45:01.200 those Stakes so hard that smoke Rose
00:45:03.960 from him and some of them even caught
00:45:08.559 fire soon the captain came over and
00:45:11.079 started watching John Henry
00:45:14.720 too son he said after a while you're the
00:45:18.800 dawn crackst steel driving man I ever
00:45:21.599 seen name's Captain Tom and I'd be
00:45:24.800 honored if you'd work for me starting
00:45:26.319 tomorrow
00:45:28.119 John Henry put down his hammer and
00:45:30.000 smiled pleased to meet you Captain Tom
00:45:33.160 my whole life I've been waiting to build
00:45:35.119 this land with a hammer in my hand and I
00:45:37.400 don't aim on waiting any longer if it
00:45:39.960 ain't any bother to y'all I'm going
00:45:41.640 start right now and with that John Henry
00:45:44.960 set straight to work on the CNO
00:45:48.240 [Music]
00:45:53.079 railroad now driving still ain't no
00:45:55.480 Fourth of July picnic
00:45:57.640 usually it takes a team of three men all
00:45:59.800 working in Rhythm to knock one steak
00:46:01.760 into the ground and usually there's a
00:46:03.880 man called a Shaker who has to hold the
00:46:06.200 steel in place while it's being hit but
00:46:09.160 John Henry had his own way of doing
00:46:12.079 things first he had the blacksmith build
00:46:15.040 him two 40 lb hammers which most men
00:46:18.000 couldn't even lift he'd hold one hammer
00:46:20.640 in each hand like a pair of drumsticks
00:46:23.359 then he take a steel steak hurl it into
00:46:25.800 the ground as if he was playing playing
00:46:27.200 dots and smash it down with one hammer
00:46:29.319 and then the next Bing Bang Boom the
00:46:32.960 whole time just singing a hammer song
00:46:36.119 fact is John Henry couldn't really
00:46:38.160 Hammer without singing and vice versa
00:46:41.200 cuz for him singing and hammering was
00:46:43.520 just different parts of the same thing
00:46:46.079 my name John Henry I'm a natural man I
00:46:50.920 was born one morning with the hammer in
00:46:54.400 my hand and every one day I F myself out
00:46:58.960 all alone I'll hammer till the evening
00:47:02.839 and found my way back
00:47:08.800 home well John Henry got so good at
00:47:12.200 driving that steel he could do the work
00:47:14.160 of 10 men in half the time he could
00:47:17.119 Hammer upside down underarm overarm
00:47:21.000 backhanded blindfolded sideways
00:47:23.880 frontways and a few ways so complicated
00:47:27.200 they can't even be explained without an
00:47:29.079 acre of blackboards and a barrel of
00:47:31.040 chalk heck he worked so fast that he
00:47:34.000 needed his own Waterman just to keep his
00:47:36.400 hammers from Catching Fire and when he
00:47:39.000 drove steel people 300 miles away could
00:47:42.839 feel the Earth
00:47:44.559 jump so John Henry worked that line and
00:47:48.160 he was happy as a bow weavil in a cotton
00:47:50.480 ball sometimes he'd ramble around the
00:47:52.720 country months at a time laying line all
00:47:55.200 over the land why John Henry laid more
00:47:58.240 line than any other man living or dead
00:48:01.400 before or
00:48:03.440 since well one day in late summer when
00:48:06.640 John Henry was back working the sea and
00:48:08.440 oine right around Big Ben Mountain a
00:48:10.920 stranger came into camp now this
00:48:13.160 stranger was all doed up and dressed to
00:48:15.359 the nine a real City Slicker who worked
00:48:17.559 for none other than Cornelius
00:48:20.520 Vanderbilt now this fell brought with
00:48:22.559 him a big Contraption which nobody had
00:48:24.800 ever seen before it was made of six
00:48:27.599 kinds of Steel and covered with dials
00:48:30.079 and gauges and drills and
00:48:32.440 hammers ah this here machine is called a
00:48:35.640 steam drill The Stranger explained when
00:48:37.960 he got in the camp and it can drive
00:48:41.319 steel five times faster than any
00:48:45.839 man now this fell wasn't making no
00:48:48.160 friends by saying a thing like that cuz
00:48:50.400 nobody likes thinking a piece of metal
00:48:52.160 can do their job but them folks got the
00:48:55.040 scratching their heads looking over that
00:48:56.760 maching figuring that maybe just maybe
00:48:59.599 it
00:49:00.400 could so them folks grew Mighty quiet
00:49:02.880 about the moues and just when things got
00:49:05.359 So Silent you could hear a ladybug yawn
00:49:08.799 when John Henry stepped
00:49:10.839 forward I'll die with a hammer in my
00:49:13.640 hand for any machine beats a man he said
00:49:15.920 it straight out with no braging assassin
00:49:18.480 then he went on a man's a man and ain't
00:49:22.559 no machine that's better than a man a
00:49:25.400 man's got a heart in side a big old
00:49:28.359 beaten heart but a machine ain't got
00:49:30.960 nothing but a soul or cold
00:49:33.680 steel on hearing this those folks nodded
00:49:36.440 in agreement but the stranger smiled and
00:49:39.319 there was a glint of gold in his
00:49:41.960 eye does that mean you're willing to
00:49:44.480 compete with my steam drill to see who
00:49:46.799 can drive more still he
00:49:49.480 asked if that's what I got to do John
00:49:51.839 Henry said I'll do it cuz I'm a natural
00:49:55.640 man and so the contest was set for 2
00:49:58.200 days away at 9:00 in the morning John
00:50:00.760 Henry versus the steam
00:50:02.960 drill and won't you know it two days
00:50:05.720 later just as the sun was stealing up
00:50:08.040 over Big Ben Mountain folks came from
00:50:10.799 all over the land came streaming into
00:50:13.839 that Valley they came by foot by horse
00:50:17.400 by buggy and by locomotive train itself
00:50:20.119 just to see John Henry whoop up on that
00:50:22.520 steam
00:50:23.480 drill at 9:00 the crowd fell silent
00:50:27.200 and the official man shot his gun into
00:50:28.920 the
00:50:30.119 air the contest had
00:50:35.200 begun on the right side was the steam
00:50:37.760 drill and that steam drill straightway
00:50:40.559 lurched into the lead a gurgling and a
00:50:42.799 spouting and making metal racket to high
00:50:45.210 [Music]
00:50:48.119 heaven there were fellas shoveling Pine
00:50:50.720 knots in its belly for fuel and that
00:50:52.960 machine was drilling holes into the
00:50:54.880 ground just as fast as buck shot
00:50:56.970 [Music]
00:51:00.760 on the left side was John Henry sweating
00:51:03.119 and flexing and letting loose with full
00:51:05.240 John Henry Force clang hidden here bang
00:51:08.680 hidden
00:51:09.830 [Music]
00:51:12.240 there the whole time singing his song
00:51:15.359 while his hammers kept a back
00:51:17.910 [Music]
00:51:25.559 beat
00:51:27.319 so in this way the hours went by 1 Hour
00:51:32.119 2
00:51:33.559 hours 3 4 5
00:51:39.359 hours the sun climbed high up in the sky
00:51:42.799 then roll back
00:51:44.590 [Music]
00:51:47.040 down and John Henry's hammers got so hot
00:51:50.440 they were just glowing like the sun
00:51:54.440 itself but that steam drill was still
00:51:57.240 [Music]
00:52:02.160 ahead at 4:00 that afternoon John Henry
00:52:05.520 and the steam drill were neck and

00:52:19.799 could hear the contest going on they

00:52:26.799 an
00:52:27.920 [Music]
00:52:29.400 alleycat and over that awful sound they
00:52:32.240 could hear John Henry's voice Sweeter

00:52:51.880 his at
00:52:53.720 5:00 just as the day was cooling down

00:52:59.160 gunshot and the race had
00:53:02.040 ended all was silent in Big Ben
00:53:05.119 tunnel outside a hush came over the
00:53:07.799 crowds and that Valley was as quiet as a
00:53:10.640 juke joint on Sunday
00:53:12.799 morning after a few minutes the official
00:53:15.920 Man Came walking out of the
00:53:17.760 tunnel he strolled right down those
00:53:20.720 tracks held his hand up high and yelled
00:53:24.799 out John Henry drove more still than the
00:53:29.359 steam drill John Henry beat the
00:53:36.839 machine and
00:53:39.160 who boy you should have heard that crowd
00:53:41.920 exploding the yipping and yelling and

00:53:49.599 won folks was a celebrating and folks
00:53:52.440 was a
00:53:55.440 dancing
00:54:00.880 then John Henry came out of that tunnel
00:54:03.319 covered from head to toe and cold dust
00:54:06.440 coughing and holding his gut as if
00:54:08.520 something had bust
00:54:11.540 [Applause]
00:54:13.559 inside so the crowds hushed again and
00:54:16.799 John Henry laid himself on the
00:54:18.950 [Music]
00:54:22.160 ground you have to forgive me folks he
00:54:25.359 said but I had to beat that steam
00:54:28.880 drill and I
00:54:31.440 did and now I'm going to my grave with a
00:54:34.720 hammer in my
00:54:35.910 [Music]
00:54:41.559 hand well nobody can believe what they
00:54:43.880 was
00:54:44.599 hearing why John Henry just whooped that
00:54:47.280 steam drill but as he was laying there
00:54:50.480 with his hammers crossed over his heart
00:54:52.240 and his face covered in cold dust John
00:54:55.240 Henry upped and and
00:54:59.480 died up and died right there front of
00:55:04.119 all those folks as the sun was going
00:55:06.920 down for the
00:55:08.780 [Music]
00:55:11.920 night now some folks say John Henry died
00:55:14.760 of a broken heart cuz he knew the steam
00:55:16.920 drill one day would take the place of
00:55:18.640 every steel driving man in the
00:55:20.680 [Music]
00:55:23.079 land others say he died of breathing too
00:55:25.640 much cold d
00:55:28.280 well it turns out John Henry didn't
00:55:30.119 really die at all he just sort of went
00:55:32.839 on a long deep sleep from which he
00:55:35.480 hasn't yet
00:55:38.000 woken and if you don't believe me shoot
00:55:40.680 you can see for
