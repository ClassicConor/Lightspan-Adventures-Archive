00:01:18.360 the stars to find your way today we'll
00:01:21.759 be traveling with Mary apprentice and
00:01:23.640 her family who are Guided by a
00:01:25.799 mysterious stranger named pegleg Joe but
00:01:29.200 before we set out out let's go to
00:01:31.200 Brooklyn New York to meet Ivon Buchanan
00:01:33.880 who made the paintings that brought all
00:01:35.759 these characters to
00:01:38.399 life I grew up in New York born and
00:01:41.119 raised here moved out to Brooklyn about
00:01:44.280 12 years ago graduated from Parsons I
00:01:47.719 always loved drawing and um when I when
00:01:51.960 I was in sixth grade my mother took
00:01:53.880 asked the teacher of Mr given if I could
00:01:57.240 uh earn a living because she at with and
00:02:00.479 because she was very um concerned about
00:02:03.560 me being able to support myself so when
00:02:05.680 once he said yes you can earn money
00:02:08.360 drawing then it's like I was let free to
00:02:12.160 do all sorts of
00:02:13.590 [Music]
00:02:15.720 things I do most of my work at home uh I
00:02:18.760 have a studio separate from the rest of
00:02:20.640 the house that I have my drawing table
00:02:23.280 my paints and I work in there when I
00:02:26.640 started doing the drawings for drinking
00:02:28.800 G I realized I needed a lot of research
00:02:31.000 I needed to know about what kind of
00:02:33.080 carts they used what the houses look
00:02:35.480 like what the clothes look like um so I
00:02:38.959 went up to the shamberg library which is
00:02:41.760 in Harlem and I got a whole batch of
00:02:43.640 pictures about plantations Farms the
00:02:47.120 type of brooms that women used the kind
00:02:49.760 of dresses they wore hats boots type of
00:02:53.920 landscape that the story took place in
00:02:56.920 just so that I can get an authentic feel
00:03:01.440 I felt I had to do the story Justice
00:03:04.480 because it tells the story of of a
00:03:07.239 little black girl and I'm a black woman
00:03:10.319 and it's an very important story I felt
00:03:14.879 it touched me um I wanted to do a good
00:03:19.599 job on it because of my family you know
00:03:23.040 what my family had gone
00:03:25.640 through when I read the script and I got
00:03:29.400 to know mared I went through a lot of
00:03:31.879 different images of her I started making
00:03:34.920 her much more expressive instead of her
00:03:37.760 being a passive little girl feeling that
00:03:40.959 she had more personality and I just
00:03:43.040 chose her eyes large and slightly curved
00:03:47.599 and eventually I came up
00:03:50.239 with with this and I realized that this
00:03:54.519 drawing looks a lot like my sister and
00:03:58.720 um and here she is illustrators usually
00:04:03.000 draw people they know when as you're
00:04:05.000 growing up and you're learning how to
00:04:06.360 draw face or hands you use your parents
00:04:09.400 you use your brothers and sisters as
00:04:10.920 models and so a lot of times you'll see
00:04:14.760 a drawing of someone made up that
00:04:17.639 actually looks like someone's parent or
00:04:19.519 someone's
00:04:22.990 [Music]
00:04:24.600 sister the story concern a little black
00:04:27.919 girl being strong which you don't really
00:04:30.560 see a lot of when I was 9 or 11 I wasn't
00:04:35.080 out in the field I was in
00:04:36.880 school this little girl was forbidden to
00:04:39.400 learn how to read forbidden Freedom
00:04:42.280 forbidden to play she had to work like
00:04:45.240 an adult really not knowing whether
00:04:48.440 everything was going to be all right
00:04:49.639 hoping that it will but not really
00:04:53.880 knowing the character pegle Joe is a a
00:04:57.440 legendary character and so I didn't want
00:05:00.000 to depict him as a person particularly
00:05:02.600 but more as a Mythic character and so I
00:05:05.720 wanted him to have lots of color in his
00:05:08.199 beard the greens the pinks and the Reds
00:05:10.560 of his beard that no one no human person
00:05:13.080 has because I think of him as a magical
00:05:15.440 person who helped spirit this family
00:05:18.319 away through the Underground
00:05:23.520 Railroad the central message the story
00:05:26.160 tells is perseverance courage this
00:05:29.720 picture takes place when Mary's mother
00:05:32.080 is telling Mary and Samuel about the
00:05:35.600 North Star the Big Dipper the drinking G
00:05:38.880 and explaining you know you follow
00:05:40.960 Northstar the freedom and this is how
00:05:44.160 get
00:05:44.880 North what I wanted to show was hope in
00:05:48.720 the mother's face and a little bit of
00:05:51.160 apprehension in the
00:05:53.440 children I feel like the power in the
00:05:55.639 story is that all these
00:05:58.639 people Mary her mother her brother are
00:06:01.600 all Ordinary People Who achieve
00:06:05.599 extraordinary things and I feel like
00:06:08.880 everyone who feels that they that
00:06:10.440 they're ordinary can achieve awesome
00:06:13.599 things so if you like to draw you should
00:06:16.360 draw every day if you like to dance you
00:06:18.360 should dance every day if you like
00:06:21.280 science you should learn about different
00:06:23.960 formulas learn about rocks you know
00:06:26.360 whatever you're interested in each day
00:06:28.680 learn something new and you realize that
00:06:30.720 you just have that give you so much
00:06:32.360 power in your own
00:06:34.479 life and now we're ready to meet Mary
00:06:37.160 apprentice and find out what it means to
00:06:40.039 Follow The Drinking
00:06:42.200 [Music]
00:06:58.520 Gourd
00:07:00.150 [Music]
00:07:40.400 Twilight's just
00:07:41.440 [Music]
00:07:42.639 Fallen the days Cotton's been counted
00:07:45.280 and
00:07:47.840 carded and out in the
00:07:50.240 night just past the willow
00:07:53.520 tree you hear the quail whistle out to
00:07:58.440 you
00:08:02.520 and that song Sprouts up at the back of
00:08:05.199 your throat about following the drinking
00:08:08.159 G about pegle
00:08:10.960 Joe about escaping North to
00:08:14.919 freedom but much as you want to sing it
00:08:18.680 you don't say a
00:08:20.159 word you just think it Follow The
00:08:24.039 Drinking
00:08:25.120 [Music]
00:08:28.440 G
00:08:30.319 it's time to
00:08:34.760 run Mary Apprentice was only 11 years
00:08:37.399 old when her mama decided to
00:08:39.559 escape see Mary her mama and her brother
00:08:43.360 Samuel were slaves on the Derby cotton
00:08:45.800 Plantation in a little town just outside
00:08:48.360 Mobile
00:08:49.959 Alabama their papa used to be there with
00:08:52.360 them except he'd been sold when Mary was
00:08:55.240 only 6 years old so as it was all three
00:08:59.440 three of them picked cotton even Mary
00:09:02.360 six days a
00:09:03.800 week it was hard work tiring
00:09:08.000 work there was something special about
00:09:10.440 Mary she had a peculiar knack for
00:09:13.079 Gathering
00:09:14.040 stories she had ears sharp enough to
00:09:16.839 pick up even the quietest Whispers that
00:09:19.160 might be floating
00:09:21.950 [Music]
00:09:24.079 about one evening right after dinner
00:09:27.800 Mary snuck down to the stable
00:09:30.600 she probably should have been helping
00:09:32.040 mama with the evening
00:09:33.560 chores but that night she was extra
00:09:36.320 curious because she'd heard mention
00:09:38.279 about Mr Darby sending some of the
00:09:40.560 slaves to
00:09:44.959 auction the stable was an awfully dark
00:09:47.680 and drafty place to visit at night and
00:09:50.519 what with all the rows of stalls and
00:09:52.399 nooks and crannis for the feed and the
00:09:54.600 tack it seemed like an enormous
00:09:57.680 maze when Mary got there The Stables
00:10:01.120 were
00:10:02.040 quiet but it didn't take long for her to
00:10:04.440 overhear some stable hands Whispering
00:10:06.240 down at the far end of the
00:10:09.360 Stalls going to send five slaves that's
00:10:13.200 what I heard Mr Darby
00:10:15.320 saying I even heard tell they'd be
00:10:18.839 selling the prce boy as
00:10:21.320 well Mary's face grew hot as an iron but
00:10:25.200 she stayed tight against the
00:10:27.399 bin maybe she'd heard wrong wrong she
00:10:30.880 wanted to run up and ask them but they
00:10:33.000 just she away a little girl like
00:10:35.240 her the voices grew softer and then shut
00:10:39.120 off immediately when someone started
00:10:40.800 banging hard on the padded
00:10:43.079 gate why had the men stopped
00:10:46.240 talking Mary ran to see who would be
00:10:48.680 making that kind of
00:10:50.430 [Music]
00:10:53.880 noise it was a wild looking fellow and
00:10:57.079 he was hammering away fast and hard
00:10:59.880 but it didn't look like he was getting
00:11:01.120 too much work
00:11:02.360 done Mary hung back a little to watch
00:11:05.080 [Music]
00:11:06.440 him he was what they like to call a
00:11:09.639 journeyman because he traveled about
00:11:11.639 during carpentry and
00:11:14.360 smithing he had rough clothes a mass of
00:11:17.839 curly hair and on his right side a peg
00:11:23.760 leg Mary's mind was swirling with the
00:11:26.279 news about Samuel but she couldn't help
00:11:28.120 watch the man
00:11:31.240 even above all the noise he was making
00:11:34.040 he kept singing the same little
00:11:37.399 song when the sun comes back and the
00:11:40.560 first Quail cries Follow The Drinking
00:11:44.880 go for the old man is weai to carry the
00:11:49.120 freedom if you follow the drink and
00:11:55.519 go Mary was about to creep back to see
00:11:58.240 if she could hear more from from the
00:11:59.399 stable hands when she saw Mr Darby
00:12:02.120 coming down the path so quickly and
00:12:04.800 quietly she whisked herself
00:12:08.079 away before she left Mary took one last
00:12:12.120 look at this peg-legged
00:12:13.839 man and maybe she was seeing
00:12:17.079 funny but it really looked as if he'd
00:12:19.560 winked right in her
00:12:22.959 Direction Mary ran down the path to home
00:12:25.600 her feet shooting up dust and her mind
00:12:27.480 heavy with the news about Samuel
00:12:30.120 before she knew it she was singing that
00:12:32.480 song she must have sung it a good 20
00:12:34.920 times
00:12:36.440 when Mama clamped her hand right smack
00:12:39.560 over Mary's mouth Mary Apprentice
00:12:42.560 where'd you go learning that
00:12:44.040 song Mama's eyes were staring at her
00:12:46.600 brighter than Mary had ever seen
00:12:48.800 them song
00:12:51.120 Mama why I just sort of picked it up
00:12:54.959 from that pig leg gouran working in the
00:12:57.959 Stables did did Papa ever talk about a
00:13:00.360 gouran like that he sure was odd over
00:13:04.560 and over he wouldn't sing nothing
00:13:07.040 [Music]
00:13:11.240 else that night Mama took Samuel and
00:13:14.560 Mary out to the willow tree out where
00:13:16.920 nobody could hear and she held them
00:13:19.600 close to tell them about the song of the
00:13:21.440 drinking
00:13:24.680 G look up to where you see the big
00:13:26.920 drinking
00:13:28.120 G up there
00:13:30.720 overhead Mama looked up at the stars and
00:13:33.880 pointed to what they sometimes call the
00:13:35.760 Big
00:13:36.519 Dipper and sometimes the big Drinking
00:13:39.920 Gourd since it looked just like the big
00:13:42.519 gourd they drank water out of when they
00:13:44.440 worked in the
00:13:46.639 fields Mama went on now follow it with
00:13:50.560 the little drinking Gore just beyond
00:13:52.759 it and right there at the tip of the
00:13:55.959 handle you can see that star shining
00:13:58.759 bright like it's looking right towards
00:14:01.040 you that's the North
00:14:04.639 Star Mary stared up at that North Star
00:14:07.480 like she was trying to memorize it while
00:14:10.160 Mama explained that the pegle man was
00:14:12.920 called pegle Joe that he wasn't just a
00:14:16.480 carpenter passing through town he'd
00:14:19.199 known Papa and he was an agent for the
00:14:22.160 Underground
00:14:24.079 Railroad so maybe Pig leg Joe's wink
00:14:26.920 wasn't just her imagination
00:14:29.920 but did this mean that Mama was talking
00:14:31.920 about escaping
00:14:34.480 North about them escaping
00:14:39.680 North Mama's voice was hushed and
00:14:43.720 serious the old man is
00:14:46.399 awaiting that's pegle Joe himself he'll
00:14:50.040 be the one to help us cross the river
00:14:51.639 into the
00:14:53.040 north when the first Quail calls means
00:14:56.800 the best time to go is spring the
00:14:59.160 weather's right the river's
00:15:01.600 High left foot Peg foot traveling on
00:15:05.560 we'll be following Peg Leg Joe's path
00:15:08.839 big leg on the right footprint on the
00:15:12.800 left Mary so wanted to ask the one
00:15:15.800 question that kept biting at
00:15:18.360 her does this mean she might see her
00:15:22.199 papa the River Bank makes a very good
00:15:25.880 road the dead trees will show you the
00:15:28.560 way
00:15:29.020 [Music]
00:15:30.600 left foot pick foot traveling on Follow
00:15:34.880 The Drinking
00:15:36.600 good the river ends between two Hills
00:15:41.319 follow the drink and
00:15:43.959 go there's another River on the other

00:15:58.759 the old man is waiting for to carry you
00:16:01.399 to Freedom follow the drink and
00:16:06.720 G next day Mary's mother handed her
00:16:10.360 something in a small red cloth and told
00:16:13.160 her to run to the stables and give it to
00:16:15.079 Peg Leg
00:16:16.519 Joe Mara didn't know what it was but she
00:16:20.160 knew it would be their signal to say
00:16:21.639 that they were ready to
00:16:24.399 go there he was hammering away in the
00:16:27.839 same place he'd been before
00:16:30.360 for at first he paid Mary no mind and
00:16:33.839 Mary wasn't sure that they could really
00:16:35.440 trust him the rail bang makes a very
00:16:38.720 good road the dead trees will show you
00:16:41.600 the
00:16:42.800 way left foot B for traveling on follow
00:16:47.959 the and
00:16:50.079 go big leg Joe kept right on banging on
00:16:53.120 the gate but Merill Drew up
00:16:57.839 close hammering grew softer so she asked
00:17:00.800 him but how do we get to the
00:17:03.630 [Music]
00:17:06.359 river your mama
00:17:09.359 knows my mama knows no such thing she's
00:17:12.640 never left the plantation said Mary your
00:17:15.679 mama doesn't say all she knows but she's
00:17:18.919 got a map of the root right in her head
00:17:22.199 only she's going to need your
00:17:25.439 help now your Papa's told me about you
00:17:29.880 and he said you as Brave as he
00:17:32.480 come and that you had enough stories in
00:17:35.320 that head of yours to fill a shelf of
00:17:38.160 books her
00:17:40.480 papa had pegle Joe seen him Mary would
00:17:44.720 have jumped up to ask all about it only
00:17:47.080 Peg Leg Joe's eyebrows tightened
00:17:48.880 together and he began hammering harder
00:17:50.799 than ever and out of the corner of her
00:17:53.200 eye Mary could see that Mr Derby was
00:17:55.440 heading right down towards the
00:17:57.840 Stables
00:17:59.360 as she rushed to get to the back gate
00:18:01.679 she dropped the cloth and out of it fell
00:18:04.480 a small wooden object about the size of
00:18:07.240 her thumb it was a tiny Drinking Gourd
00:18:11.280 and Mary knew looking at it that Papa
00:18:13.080 must have whittled it
00:18:15.600 himself there wasn't time to run back so
00:18:18.000 she tossed a little gourd straight back
00:18:19.640 to Peg Leg Joe and waited to watch him
00:18:21.480 catch
00:18:21.720 [Music]
00:18:23.080 it before long she was back on the path
00:18:26.440 to
00:18:27.240 home but she was well she could hear Peg
00:18:29.720 Leg Joe say I'll be seeing you at the
00:18:33.550 [Music]
00:18:38.080 river that very night Mama brought Mary
00:18:41.280 and Samuel back out to the willow tree
00:18:43.200 and wrapped them up in extra sets of
00:18:45.360 clothes not a single word came across
00:18:48.120 Mama's lips but Mary knew that this was
00:18:51.000 it it was time to
00:18:54.700 [Music]
00:18:56.200 run Mary took a good look at the North
00:18:58.799 star to make sure it was looking out for
00:19:00.480 them and off she went one step behind
00:19:03.799 Samuel and two steps behind mama who
00:19:07.320 carried only a cotton sack of food and
00:19:10.120 the great big walking stick Papa had
00:19:12.240 carved for
00:19:13.370 [Music]
00:19:18.240 her they had to get to the Tom Big B
00:19:20.880 River Before Dawn to hide their
00:19:23.919 Trail when Master Derby found them
00:19:26.280 missing he was sure to set out with the
00:19:27.919 hunting dogs
00:19:29.510 [Music]
00:19:36.159 Mary's legs grew
00:19:39.080 tired seemed like Mama and Samuel were
00:19:45.360 running Mary crouched down on a stone to
00:19:48.360 rest but Mama shook her
00:19:51.000 awake she gave her a biscuit from the
00:19:53.400 sack and rubbed Mary's feet they were
00:19:56.440 sore and
00:19:57.640 blistered
00:20:02.010 [Music]
00:20:05.880 when they made it to the river the sun
00:20:08.159 was beginning to
00:20:09.799 rise and Mary could hear growing
00:20:12.440 from a nearby
00:20:15.280 Farm Mr Darby would noce soon that they
00:20:17.840 weren't in the
00:20:23.120 fields at the riverbank Mama pointed to
00:20:26.600 the ground with her walking stick
00:20:29.880 left foot Peg
00:20:31.840 foot there were Peg Leg Joe's marks left
00:20:35.520 for them to
00:20:36.900 [Music]
00:20:43.520 follow that day for many days they
00:20:46.559 traveled the riverbank at night and hid
00:20:49.039 during the day in nearby swamps and
00:20:52.520 marshes they followed Peg Leg Joe's
00:20:54.919 Footprints until at one Bend in the
00:20:56.960 river the prince stood
00:21:00.679 disappeared they still had the drinking
00:21:02.720 Gord as their guide but each day they
00:21:05.280 grew more tired and hungry and they ate
00:21:08.320 less and less as the food began running
00:21:12.130 [Music]
00:21:13.640 out that was when they decided that
00:21:15.799 Samuel and Mary would hide out by the
00:21:17.600 nearest Plantation to see if they could
00:21:19.320 get more
00:21:23.120 food if we are where I think we are
00:21:26.919 you'll find the slaves quarters right
00:21:28.600 right next to the
00:21:29.919 barn wait by the barn and when it's
00:21:33.600 pitch dark you make the quail's call
00:21:37.000 nice and
00:21:38.200 soft and if you see a lantern light up
00:21:40.679 in the slaves quarter's four pained
00:21:42.960 window there'll be someone to help you
00:21:45.520 said
00:21:46.720 Mama Mary and Samuel waited until night
00:21:49.559 to
00:21:51.780 [Music]
00:21:53.080 run they hid by the barn and tried
00:21:56.440 singing like the quail
00:22:06.600 no light came
00:22:09.159 on so they
00:22:13.080 waited and
00:22:16.520 waited when it was so dark that they
00:22:18.760 could barely see each other sure enough
00:22:21.840 they saw a hand light a tiny Lantern in
00:22:24.279 the four pained
00:22:27.520 window they leaned themselves hard
00:22:29.880 against the barn and before long someone
00:22:33.880 handed them a heavy cotton
00:22:37.080 sack Mary could see only the outline of
00:22:39.760 a very old face and a man bent over with
00:22:45.400 age they've seen you Mary and Samuel the
00:22:49.000 man's voice was a
00:22:50.840 whisper how' you know our name asked
00:22:54.200 Mary there are posters up all over town
00:22:57.880 your m been sending out the alarm up the
00:23:00.559 whole
00:23:01.880 river but where do we go if we can't use
00:23:04.760 the river Samuel
00:23:06.760 asked there's pepper in the sack shake
00:23:10.799 it after you if the dogs are near it
00:23:14.200 gets them off your Trail and follow the
00:23:17.600 drinking
00:23:18.960 G if you make it past this stretch
00:23:22.480 you'll only have a few more days of
00:23:24.520 following the river and when you reach
00:23:27.400 the Tennessee
00:23:29.520 there are good people there
00:23:32.600 Quakers they'll know you're
00:23:35.640 coming they helped your
00:23:38.960 papa how will they
00:23:41.400 know she waited to hear more but there
00:23:45.080 was no
00:23:46.279 answer the old man was
00:23:53.880 [Music]
00:23:56.000 gone Mary Samuel and Mama took took to
00:23:58.760 the
00:23:59.480 woods the river was no longer
00:24:02.360 safe they moved slowly fighting against
00:24:05.600 the vines and
00:24:07.640 undergrowth it didn't help to think that
00:24:09.840 there were people after them ready to
00:24:11.400 catch them for
00:24:12.580 [Music]
00:24:14.840 money Mary and Samuel shook the pepper
00:24:17.679 behind them and as much as she hated the
00:24:20.039 murky water and Squishy mud Mary wished
00:24:23.640 she were back by the
00:24:27.360 river
00:24:29.240 Mary was first to hear the
00:24:31.240 dogs mama said pay them no mind that
00:24:34.559 they might just be chasing rabbits but
00:24:37.080 as the bargain came closer the three
00:24:39.480 knew they'd better do
00:24:42.039 something the river was too far to run
00:24:44.440 back to so Mama threw the rest of the
00:24:46.559 pepper onto the ground and pulled Mary
00:24:48.640 and Samuel into a Cascade of hundreds of
00:24:50.960 kudzu
00:24:52.490 [Music]
00:24:53.760 Vines there was a small Hollow Place
00:24:56.320 just large enough for them to crouch
00:24:57.760 into
00:24:59.679 the three of them squatted low and so
00:25:02.399 close together it was hard to tell one
00:25:04.320 heartbeat from
00:25:05.919 another Mama gripped them
00:25:10.770 [Music]
00:25:12.000 tight the dogs were getting
00:25:14.399 close barking louder faster as if they
00:25:18.360 knew just where the three
00:25:20.120 were before long there were hores with
00:25:24.360 brusk voices coaxing the dogs on $1,000
00:25:27.799 for the boy come on dogs crack them
00:25:30.080 [Music]
00:25:31.679 down Mary waited sure they were
00:25:35.720 caught she could hardly believe it when
00:25:37.880 the dog stopped barking and started to
00:25:40.720 whine the pepper had
00:25:43.399 worked she saw Mama's mouth loosen into
00:25:46.080 a
00:25:47.919 smile a few days later Mary Samuel and
00:25:51.640 Mama came up a clearing in the woods and
00:25:54.600 Beyond it a small
00:25:57.240 town it surely wasn't a place that three
00:25:59.679 of them could walk into in fact there
00:26:02.240 were probably posters right there with
00:26:04.320 descriptions of
00:26:06.000 them but there on the other side of the
00:26:09.159 town was the Tennessee
00:26:11.880 River that night the three of them
00:26:14.279 slipped through the clearing like
00:26:16.080 cats then Mary heard something footsteps
00:26:20.640 and they were close the three darted
00:26:23.360 over to a cemetery and hid behind the
00:26:25.039 biggest Tombstone they could reach but
00:26:27.039 the footsteps kept after them
00:26:29.799 art thou not EST
00:26:31.520 Apprentice Mama didn't say a
00:26:33.960 word but Mary saw her lift up her head
00:26:38.120 slowly it was a Quaker
00:26:40.679 man he had a neatly trimmed beard shaped
00:26:43.720 just along his
00:26:45.640 Jawbone the man explained that they were
00:26:47.880 in great danger there were slave
00:26:50.360 catchers looking for them all about the
00:26:51.760 two rivers the Tennessee and the
00:26:54.600 Ohio he said that if they could make it
00:26:56.840 to his boat more Bo just at the dock
00:27:00.039 then he could take them safely straight
00:27:01.679 up the Tennessee
00:27:04.190 [Music]
00:27:06.000 River with Mama in the lead they made
00:27:09.520 themselves invisible darting from
00:27:11.600 building to building crouching low and
00:27:13.440 scarcely
00:27:17.799 breathing when they reached the boat
00:27:20.640 Mary's eyes opened wide with wonder when
00:27:23.000 she saw the secret compartment under the
00:27:27.159 deck
00:27:28.720 she and her family slipped down into it
00:27:31.600 and listened while the Quaker man and
00:27:33.799 his wife and son piled sack upon sack of
00:27:37.520 flow and Dry Goods over the secret
00:27:44.880 door that next morning Mary and her
00:27:48.679 family traveled up the Tennessee in
00:27:51.120 broad daylight without even a single
00:27:53.960 slave catcher guessing where they might
00:27:57.120 be
00:28:00.960 the Quaker man warned them that their
00:28:03.159 last stop the Ohio River was Rife with
00:28:06.399 patrols and even pegle Joe couldn't
00:28:09.039 guard against
00:28:10.399 that as the song said the river that was
00:28:14.399 the Tennessee ends between two hills and
00:28:18.039 there's another River on the other
00:28:20.360 side it took days to find any trace of
00:28:23.320 pig leg Joe it was Mary who spotted the
00:28:26.600 prince left foot pegf fooot and they
00:28:30.080 raced to the end of the path to find a
00:28:32.240 tiny Inlet tucked into the hills there
00:28:35.640 they found more
00:28:36.919 Prints but pegle Joe was nowhere to be
00:28:40.919 seen Mary felt her heart drop and her
00:28:44.519 eyes grew hot with
00:28:46.919 tears but then to her
00:28:50.640 amazement out from behind the trees
00:28:53.600 stepped
00:28:55.120 papa
00:28:57.039 papa
00:29:00.270 [Music]
00:29:02.279 Mary thought it was a dream but Papa
00:29:05.000 gripped her hand tight and placed in it
00:29:08.600 the tiny drinking
00:29:13.200 GD Papa looked tired but he pulled Mama
00:29:17.200 Samuel and Mary as close as he could and
00:29:20.240 held on to
00:29:21.519 them Mary wasn't sure he would ever let
00:29:24.960 [Music]
00:29:27.039 go
00:29:29.120 he said that all along the way he'd
00:29:31.679 heard about mama and her two Brave
00:29:34.480 children and that that gave him the
00:29:36.840 courage to run almost without
00:29:40.000 stopping there was lots to tell but they
00:29:43.480 still were not across the
00:29:46.440 river at
00:29:48.279 nightfall papa took them by the hand and
00:29:51.360 led them forward to pegle
00:29:53.640 Joe when they reached the coold where
00:29:55.919 pegle Joe's boat was hidden
00:29:58.840 there he was waiting for
00:30:06.960 them the moon hid behind the clouds to
00:30:09.880 let them cross and the river frog seemed
00:30:12.880 to be croing especially hard to wish
00:30:15.440 them
00:30:16.300 [Music]
00:30:19.440 luck big leg Joe rode them across soft
00:30:23.880 and quiet as
00:30:25.559 swans right past the patrol
00:30:29.320 until the boat
00:30:30.559 slowed and with a soft bump they came to
00:30:34.320 the other side of the
00:30:37.170 [Music]
00:30:38.880 river they still had a journey ahead of
00:30:41.360 them until they were entirely
00:30:43.279 safe but this was
00:30:46.919 it they were
00:30:49.039 together and on their way to
00:30:52.760 freedom and Mary could hear herself
00:30:55.159 telling the story of their escape over
00:30:58.760 and over in the days to
00:31:04.320 come the R Bank makes a very good road
00:31:08.919 the dead trees will show you the
00:31:11.760 way left foot pick foot traveling on

00:31:18.760 good the river ends between to Hills

00:31:43.519 the freedom follow the drink and




00:33:58.200 come on
00:33:59.720 in settle
00:34:02.039 back it's curtain time at the story lane
00:34:05.519 theater you've never seen a stage like
00:34:07.960 this
00:34:09.000 one anything can happen
00:34:25.040 here in a few minutes we'll see King
00:34:27.960 Midas and the Golden Touch but first
00:34:31.119 come on Backstage to meet Eric Maxis he
00:34:34.359 wrote the words for the
00:34:37.159 story this is Eric's favorite place to
00:34:39.960 write let's listen to Eric tell how he
00:34:42.679 goes about creating a
00:34:44.839 story the process of writing usually
00:34:47.719 starts way before you actually pick up
00:34:50.480 the pen or sit down in front of the word
00:34:52.918 processor usually uh when I write I'm
00:34:56.960 writing a story in my mind um before I'm
00:35:00.359 actually writing it down on paper I'm
00:35:02.119 beginning to put it together and
00:35:03.480 beginning to try to get the themes and
00:35:05.079 the ideas of what I want to say and in a
00:35:07.359 way I'm editing uh the ideas in my mind
00:35:10.480 and then I'll sit down and I'll already
00:35:12.680 sort of know what I want to say so I'll
00:35:14.400 just sit down and I'll write um then
00:35:17.880 when I'm finished uh maybe a day later
00:35:20.320 I'll go back and I'll reread it and I'll
00:35:22.599 realize that oh there's all kinds of
00:35:24.200 stuff that I wrote down that I didn't
00:35:26.880 say as well as I could say it so I'll
00:35:29.560 rewrite this paragraph and I'll add a
00:35:31.599 few sentences here where something's not
00:35:33.440 clear and I'll get rid of this whole
00:35:35.240 paragraph that I wrote yesterday because
00:35:37.520 it's not really uh saying what I wanted
00:35:39.880 it to say one of the reasons that I uh
00:35:43.800 was so eager to write the story of King
00:35:45.280 Midas is because it's a Greek story and
00:35:47.480 because I'm Greek um and we can trace my
00:35:50.119 relatives back uh 540 years uh in the
00:35:53.079 very same place on the island of seonia
00:35:54.920 the Maxis family has been there and um
00:35:57.720 actually have a a picture of some of my
00:36:00.119 uh my relatives this is my
00:36:03.800 great-grandfather pisti and that's his
00:36:06.680 wife elenie uh this is my grandmother
00:36:09.760 Renee and her twin sister
00:36:12.920 angeliki panizo was a writer uh he made
00:36:17.599 his living as an educator uh School
00:36:20.200 principal and he wrote a lot of books
00:36:22.400 and um my father always kids me that uh
00:36:25.000 that's sort of where I get my my writing
00:36:26.560 Talent from uh from panagis vertis that
00:36:29.119 it's his jeans but my father also tells
00:36:31.359 me that uh that his wife elenni when she
00:36:34.480 was older she was a real storyteller
00:36:36.480 that she would tell the neighborhood
00:36:37.480 kids stories and my father of course
00:36:39.280 remembers uh sitting with the
00:36:40.839 neighborhood kids at her feet while she
00:36:42.599 would sort of uh Spin A Yarn and I've
00:36:45.079 got another picture of her here when she
00:36:48.040 was a little bit younger probably about
00:36:49.280 19 years old she was quite a Storyteller
00:36:51.920 too so in a way we have two different
00:36:54.119 kinds of storytellers in my family we
00:36:56.280 have the oral storyteller uh and we have
00:36:58.640 the the
00:36:59.800 writer uh in the story of King Midas
00:37:02.839 there's uh something that uh I put in
00:37:06.880 because it's very similar to what
00:37:08.079 happened to me when I was in Greece when
00:37:10.240 I was in Greece everybody went uh to
00:37:12.480 sleep during the afternoons because it
00:37:13.960 was so the sun was so bright and so hot
00:37:16.960 uh but when I was there I didn't uh I
00:37:19.920 kind of enjoyed the fact that everybody
00:37:21.599 had gone to sleep and I could sort of
00:37:22.960 walk around and it was really peaceful
00:37:25.359 and I felt like I had the whole world to
00:37:26.800 myself um and in the story of King Midas
00:37:30.200 uh both King Midas and his daughter Zoe
00:37:33.640 uh they also stay up uh during the
00:37:35.839 afternoon because it's really quiet and
00:37:38.280 there's a line in the story about where
00:37:40.880 uh Zoe enjoyed them enjoyed the
00:37:43.079 afternoon so much that she didn't like
00:37:44.640 to go to sleep so I put a little piece
00:37:46.040 of myself uh in Zoey when I was writing
00:37:48.760 the
00:37:50.280 story a lot of times when uh I'm having
00:37:53.359 problems um putting pen to paper and I'm
00:37:57.040 at a sort of a rough spot in the writing
00:37:58.880 process I'll just want to get away from
00:38:01.079 everything for a few minutes uh and a
00:38:02.800 lot of times I'll take a walk and I
00:38:04.599 usually I go to a park that's near here
00:38:06.960 which is really really beautiful and
00:38:08.920 there are very very few people there and
00:38:10.599 so in a lot of ways it reminds me of uh
00:38:14.040 the afternoon walks I used to take when
00:38:15.480 I was in Greece because you feel like
00:38:16.760 you're the only person in the world and
00:38:18.440 you can be completely alone with your
00:38:23.720 thoughts sometimes when I uh when I'm in
00:38:26.319 a place that's as beautiful as a place
00:38:27.800 like this uh it really amazes me that
00:38:30.560 there's really nothing that you could do
00:38:31.800 to improve upon it it's so beautiful
00:38:33.720 that the best thing you could possibly
00:38:35.480 do is to try to take it in to try to
00:38:37.960 appreciate it for what it is um and I
00:38:41.000 think in the story where King Midas goes
00:38:43.040 wrong is that he's not content uh with
00:38:46.359 what he has he really seems to think if
00:38:49.200 he could just do one more thing if that
00:38:51.319 beautiful butterfly could just be golden
00:38:55.079 uh then he'd have everything he wanted
00:38:57.280 but but
00:38:58.400 sometimes if you're not content with the
00:39:00.640 beauty of things with the beauty of the
00:39:02.040 water and the beauty of the the flowers
00:39:04.960 uh and being with the people that you
00:39:06.119 care about uh and you reach for that one
00:39:09.960 thing to try to make it better the way
00:39:11.520 King Midas Did you sort of can ruin
00:39:13.119 everything and that's really uh what
00:39:15.240 happens to him in the story and uh
00:39:17.920 everything that he had the beauty all
00:39:19.359 around him sort of gets destroyed and he
00:39:21.560 learns a painful lesson that uh there
00:39:23.800 are many things in life that are worth a
00:39:25.760 lot more than gold
00:39:28.240 thanks for sharing those thoughts with
00:39:29.760 us Eric and now let's watch King Midas
00:39:33.240 and the Golden

00:40:34.390 [Music]
00:40:41.240 Once Upon a Time about 27 centuries ago
00:40:44.520 actually somewhere on the coast of what
00:40:46.839 is now
00:40:48.240 turkey there was a sunny Kingdom called
00:40:52.440 friia and for many years the ruler of
00:40:54.960 this kingdom was a certain King m
00:41:04.680 us now King Midas was a very wealthy man
00:41:08.480 indeed he had everything money could buy
00:41:11.599 but of all the things he possessed in
00:41:13.280 the world he valued nothing more than
00:41:15.760 his only
00:41:17.800 daughter she was as dear to him as life
00:41:21.319 itself and it was for this very reason
00:41:24.319 that he named her Zoey which means
00:41:29.330 [Music]
00:41:37.040 life because the sun is very strong in
00:41:39.760 friia most of the people who have ever
00:41:42.079 lived there prefer to sleep during the
00:41:44.359 afternoons and do their work during the
00:41:46.800 cooler hours of the morning and evening
00:41:49.560 but it was precisely during those hot
00:41:51.440 afternoon hours that King midas's
00:41:53.640 Daughter loved to play most and so
00:41:56.200 dearly did the king love his daughter
00:41:58.480 that he could not refuse her this
00:42:00.720 wish so as his servant slept he would
00:42:04.280 contentedly sit and watch her play from
00:42:06.079 the cool shade of his grape arbor which
00:42:08.880 overlooked his magnificent Gardens which
00:42:11.480 in turn overlooked the Brilliant Blue
00:42:15.240 Sea and during many of the long sleepy
00:42:18.160 afternoons in which he sat watching her
00:42:20.559 run about chasing birds and smelling
00:42:23.359 flowers it was King midas's particular
00:42:25.960 Habit to care carefully count out some
00:42:28.359 number of the gold coins that he
00:42:31.119 possessed there was quite a large number
00:42:33.480 of them in fact he never could have
00:42:36.720 counted them all and each and every one
00:42:39.680 of them large and small was exquisitly
00:42:43.160 minted with the king's own Regal
00:42:46.960 profile the likeness was perfect to the
00:42:49.800 very tiniest detail and had it not been
00:42:52.960 for the small cosmetic addition of the
00:42:55.640 six raid crown of the s God Helios with
00:42:58.839 whom in his heart of hearts good King
00:43:01.240 midest like to be identified one might
00:43:04.119 have easily mistaken the miniature
00:43:05.839 golden image for the very King
00:43:09.780 [Music]
00:43:16.160 himself now one day as he was sitting
00:43:19.559 there in the arbor counting his
00:43:22.680 coins the king observed his daughter
00:43:25.160 following a beautiful white butterfly
00:43:27.760 as it flitted lazily down one of the
00:43:29.800 garden
00:43:30.930 [Music]
00:43:33.640 paths the butterfly was so marvelously
00:43:36.359 delicate as to be almost
00:43:41.000 transparent and as King Midas watched it
00:43:43.920 he could not help but admire the
00:43:45.960 exceptional freedom and beauty of the
00:43:48.350 [Music]
00:43:56.040 creature
00:43:58.559 but as he beheld it the strong rays of
00:44:01.319 the frian sun came to illuminate it in
00:44:04.640 such a way that for some time as it
00:44:07.160 floated before him it seemed to him to
00:44:10.079 be made entirely of
00:44:15.000 gold the sight of this had the power of
00:44:18.830 [Music]
00:44:21.559 Revelation and it so completely
00:44:23.800 transfixed the king that long after the
00:44:26.640 BF had flown out of his Ken and on its
00:44:29.640 way he remained staring at where it had
00:44:33.440 been as though under a powerful
00:44:38.560 [Music]
00:44:41.720 spell and when he came to himself again
00:44:44.640 he remained consumed with the idea of it
00:44:47.880 a butterfly made of
00:44:50.160 gold
00:44:52.040 astounding I've never seen anything as
00:44:54.359 beautiful in my life I simply must have
00:44:57.599 one a butterfly made of
00:45:00.120 [Music]
00:45:03.480 gold now the idea of wanting a golden
00:45:06.160 butterfly seemed at the time to be quite
00:45:09.480 harmless after all he only wanted it to
00:45:12.200 be able to give it to his
00:45:15.480 daughter but as he ruminated further on
00:45:18.040 the great Beauty and worth of such an
00:45:20.079 object his small wish for a Golden
00:45:22.640 Butterfly blossomed into an overwhelming
00:45:25.960 desire that everything in the world
00:45:28.839 might become
00:45:30.680 gold how beautiful the world would be if
00:45:34.240 all things could be transformed as
00:45:36.480 magnificently as the butterfly had he
00:45:38.359 thought to
00:45:39.359 himself if only I had the power to
00:45:42.040 accomplish it I should give anything to
00:45:45.000 have that power anything at
00:45:48.119 all his obsession with this thought did
00:45:50.680 not leave him for several weeks but one
00:45:53.400 day when the wish became so fervent that
00:45:56.119 he thought he couldn't stand it another
00:45:57.880 moment the king looked up and saw a
00:46:01.280 golden Chariot descending towards him
00:46:04.599 out of the bright
00:46:07.040 Sun the Curious being who debarked from
00:46:09.880 it was dressed entirely in gold and
00:46:13.359 claimed to be a messenger of none other
00:46:15.280 than Helios the lightbearer
00:46:18.839 himself your most fervent wish has been
00:46:21.720 heard good King Midas he said and it is
00:46:25.240 our Majesty's equally f wish that it
00:46:28.319 should be
00:46:29.599 granted therefore as soon as the sun
00:46:32.520 rises tomorrow you shall possess your
00:46:36.359 desire for as you will then perceive all
00:46:39.880 that you touch from that time forth
00:46:42.520 shall turn to the purest
00:46:45.319 gold then with a flourish of his hand he
00:46:48.720 conjured a brilliant box which he said
00:46:50.960 contained a golden piece of the very Sun
00:46:55.839 itself
00:46:57.680 a small gift for the good King he said
00:47:01.160 for the good and great King
00:47:04.079 Midas naturally King Midas was deeply
00:47:06.880 impressed but when he reached out to
00:47:09.000 touch the gift it burned his hand ah yes
00:47:13.760 said the odd man with a queer smile
00:47:16.880 perhaps such a gift wasn't meant for
00:47:18.680 your kind after all with that he climbed
00:47:22.319 back into his guilded Chariot and again
00:47:24.920 ascended into the blinding brilliance of
00:47:27.359 the afternoon
00:47:29.160 sun of course all this made the king
00:47:31.839 quite eager for the next day but when
00:47:34.440 the sun's first Rays entered his chamber
00:47:36.559 in the morning he became terribly
00:47:39.680 uncomfortable he tossed and turned
00:47:42.119 endlessly about in his bed but he was
00:47:44.760 unable to find another Moment's Peace
00:47:47.680 and it was at some point soon thereafter
00:47:50.680 that he came to realize that the very
00:47:52.640 bed upon which he
00:47:54.400 lay was made entirely of
00:47:58.359 gold now as you will doubtless
00:48:00.800 understand the king's Joy at this
00:48:02.119 realization can hardly be
00:48:04.319 described and the small price of a few
00:48:06.880 hours of lost sleep was simply Unworthy
00:48:09.280 of comparing with the Exquisite Joy he
00:48:11.400 now felt oh he was
00:48:14.070 [Music]
00:48:16.960 elited it next occurred to him that the
00:48:19.800 odd messenger's promise must have come
00:48:21.760 true and anything he touched might now
00:48:25.079 turn to gold
00:48:27.520 without a moment's hesitation he was out
00:48:29.640 of the bed and furiously looking about
00:48:31.359 the room for a suitable object on which
00:48:33.559 to
00:48:36.400 experiment he grew quite dizzy at the
00:48:39.000 prospect of it
00:48:42.040 all at last his eyes came to rest on an
00:48:45.800 ornately carved
00:48:47.960 chair he immediately moved toward it and
00:48:52.240 then ever so
00:48:55.720 cautiously
00:48:57.280 he touched
00:48:58.520 it instantly it was transformed into a
00:49:02.000 chair of the purest
00:49:07.040 gold on examining it more closely King
00:49:10.160 Midas saw that every part of it had been
00:49:12.680 transformed the upholstery the carved
00:49:15.200 wood even the braided tassels that hung
00:49:17.400 from it were
00:49:20.680 gold he could hardly believe his
00:49:24.280 eyes but the remarkable metamorphosis
00:49:27.079 only seemed to wet his appetite for
00:49:29.960 more he saw a table just outside his bed
00:49:33.000 chamber and he touched
00:49:35.799 it he touched the
00:49:38.920 tapestry then as fast as his legs could
00:49:41.400 carry him he ran into the
00:49:44.480 garden he touched a marble statue a
00:49:48.720 vase and everything he touched every
00:49:52.440 single thing turned to gold
00:49:57.880 it was more than he could
00:50:00.880 bear then King Midas stooped to pick up
00:50:03.839 a White pebble and no sooner had he
00:50:05.960 touched it and it was gold he saw
00:50:08.440 another Stone slightly larger and
00:50:10.839 touched that and it too became
00:50:14.960 gold the king next spotted a large C
00:50:18.119 shell that his daughter had discovered
00:50:19.720 on the
00:50:21.520 seashore he remembered the day she had
00:50:23.680 found it and recalled holding the shell
00:50:26.119 to her ear ear so that she could hear
00:50:28.119 the sounds of the ocean inside
00:50:30.060 [Music]
00:50:31.319 it and how she heard it saying
00:50:35.240 thaser
00:50:37.000 thala
00:50:38.680 thala like the waves of the
00:50:41.260 [Music]
00:50:45.079 sea in a Flash he touched it and it too
00:50:50.200 was transformed to Gold before his very
00:50:54.040 eyes it was magnificent
00:50:57.240 he lifted the golden conch to examine it
00:50:59.799 and hold it to his ear unable to imagine
00:51:03.000 what golden music should come out of it
00:51:06.040 now but he found that it was extremely
00:51:09.240 heavy and when he held it up to his ear
00:51:12.680 he heard
00:51:13.920 absolutely
00:51:16.440 nothing now normally this would have
00:51:18.960 saddened King Midas but under the
00:51:21.119 circumstances his thoughts turned rather
00:51:22.920 quickly to the subject of what other
00:51:24.880 objects he might turn to gold
00:51:27.720 in a moment his attention was captured
00:51:30.200 by a beautiful
00:51:31.599 flower and when he touched it the leaves
00:51:35.440 the stem every petal and even the
00:51:38.119 intricate Universe within the petals
00:51:40.480 turned to
00:51:41.640 Gold he quickly touched another flower
00:51:44.040 and then another and another it was all
00:51:46.160 too much to
00:51:47.599 behold then King Midas saw a white
00:51:55.520 butterfly
00:52:01.240 it was quite like the one that he had so
00:52:03.359 admired some weeks
00:52:05.720 before and as he was powerless to do
00:52:08.000 anything else he began to chase
00:52:10.160 [Music]
00:52:15.119 it the chase took him down one Garden
00:52:18.040 Path and then another until as carefree
00:52:19.920 as a small child he completely lost
00:52:22.440 track of
00:52:25.520 himself
00:52:29.280 the butterfly eventually led him along
00:52:31.040 the very edge of the castle parapet
00:52:33.240 overlooking the
00:52:35.480 ocean and because the idea of having a
00:52:37.960 golden butterfly consumed him so
00:52:40.480 completely he quite forgot about the
00:52:42.599 long drop to the Rocks below and
00:52:44.640 continued to chase it teetering along
00:52:47.040 the edge of the parapet as the butterfly
00:52:49.160 danced just out of his
00:52:53.040 reach at last reaching so far out that
00:52:56.720 he nearly fell the king succeeded in
00:52:59.400 grazing the creature's gossimer wing
00:53:01.640 with the tip of his outstretched index
00:53:05.640 finger but on the very instant that he
00:53:08.640 did so it stiffened to gold and fell
00:53:13.000 away out of his
00:53:15.480 reach down down it fell all the way to
00:53:19.799 the seawash Rocks below where it hit
00:53:22.839 with a dull plink and disappeared among
00:53:25.920 the barn called
00:53:27.480 crevices a lifeless
00:53:30.130 [Music]
00:53:35.040 B King Midas stood there staring at
00:53:40.000 where it had fallen unable to believe
00:53:41.920 what he had just
00:53:42.830 [Music]
00:53:44.839 seen he had never
00:53:47.160 considered that he might kill the poor
00:53:51.050 [Music]
00:53:55.440 creature
00:54:00.760 as he wound his way back to the Palace
00:54:03.000 King Midas passed several ancient olive
00:54:05.160 trees and tired from his Chase he leaned
00:54:08.319 up against a particularly venerable
00:54:10.920 specimen as soon as he touched the trunk
00:54:13.200 of the great tree however everything
00:54:15.920 above him and around him froze into a
00:54:19.079 single golden
00:54:20.799 moment it was an extraordinary sight the
00:54:24.760 entire tree it's Mammoth Nile trunk
00:54:28.520 every Branch every oval Leaf every Green
00:54:31.760 Olive had turned to
00:54:35.040 Gold King mider saw that even the
00:54:37.720 hundreds of ants and other tiny insects
00:54:40.400 on the tree had turned to
00:54:42.920 Gold he beheld a golden inchworm Frozen
00:54:47.400 in the act of measuring its last
00:54:50.640 inch there was a golden nest of golden
00:54:53.319 eggs that would never hatch and a golden
00:54:56.079 heart of bees that would never produce
00:54:58.640 honey
00:54:59.720 again then in a remote branch of the
00:55:03.480 tree he beheld the dazzling tracery of a
00:55:07.480 golden spider's
00:55:09.240 web and finally a long descending strand
00:55:14.200 of golden spider
00:55:16.280 silk and the attached arachnid who had
00:55:19.440 spun it and would spin no
00:55:23.760 more when he finally returned to the
00:55:26.000 Palace he called to his servants to
00:55:27.680 prepare a banquet and cheerily announced
00:55:29.520 to them that it would all be on plates
00:55:31.480 of gold although they were quite puzzled
00:55:34.079 they complied with his request and no
00:55:36.599 sooner than they had set a plate before
00:55:38.240 him did he touch it and turn it into
00:55:40.640 gold Before Their
00:55:42.319 Eyes everyone was completely astounded
00:55:45.400 but King Midas only laughed and
00:55:47.119 performed his magic on the silver goblet
00:55:49.520 that was set before him he then
00:55:51.799 proceeded to turn all the serving
00:55:53.400 platters to gold as well as the very
00:55:55.839 table on which they were
00:55:57.760 placed but when the novelty eroded and
00:56:00.240 King Midas at last decided to get down
00:56:02.319 to the actual business of eating a
00:56:05.079 curious thing
00:56:06.570 [Music]
00:56:11.400 happened you see when he picked up a fig
00:56:14.640 to put it in his mouth it too turned to
00:56:17.640 solid
00:56:20.440 gold and when he tried to pour himself a
00:56:22.920 glass of wine both the bottle as well as
00:56:25.319 the liquid inside became
00:56:28.599 gold he then grew frantic grabbing first
00:56:31.720 a cluster of gripes and then a handful
00:56:33.359 of
00:56:34.920 Olives but to his great consternation
00:56:38.079 each and everything that he touched
00:56:40.039 turned quite indisputably into an object
00:56:42.079 of solid
00:56:44.079 gold the king became deeply
00:56:47.000 distressed he would soon
00:56:54.480 starve just then the king's daughter
00:56:57.119 came running out of the palace to greet
00:57:00.799 him King Midas was so delighted to see
00:57:03.680 her that he quickly embraced
00:57:05.230 [Music]
00:57:08.240 her but no sooner did he do this than he
00:57:11.680 recoiled in
00:57:13.839 horror for the Golden Touch with which
00:57:16.599 he had been lately cursed had worked its
00:57:19.839 hideous magic even on his precious
00:57:22.880 daughter whom he loved beyond anything
00:57:24.880 in the world
00:57:29.640 oh my Zoe he
00:57:31.319 cried my dear
00:57:33.319 Zoe I have lost my dear
00:57:36.210 [Music]
00:57:43.200 Zoe in his grief he began running he
00:57:45.920 knew not
00:57:49.280 where after a Time the king found
00:57:51.440 himself at the edge of a stream he sat
00:57:54.599 down exhausted and putting his face in
00:57:57.039 his hands he began to
00:57:59.599 sob I have lost my Zoey he
00:58:02.640 cried I have killed everything that I
00:58:05.000 have touched and now I have killed the
00:58:07.000 very thing in the world that was dearest
00:58:09.119 to me I don't wish to live I don't care
00:58:12.720 if I am the richest man in the
00:58:15.039 universe but as he was crying the king
00:58:18.119 noticed an odd thing for somehow the
00:58:22.039 tears that were on his cheeks and in his
00:58:24.920 hands had hadn't turned to Gold nor
00:58:29.160 inexplicably had the stone upon which
00:58:31.359 his hand
00:58:33.079 rested was it
00:58:45.799 possible as fast as he could King Midas
00:58:48.760 ran back to the
00:58:55.039 Palace
00:58:57.559 with great trepidation he touched one of
00:59:00.280 the flowers that he had turned to
00:59:03.079 gold in an instant it became a living
00:59:05.599 flower
00:59:08.799 again he touched another and
00:59:12.160 another oh this is much too good to be
00:59:14.920 true the king
00:59:17.799 thought the king then ran to where his
00:59:20.079 daughter stood at the sight of her tears
00:59:23.359 came to his eyes
00:59:25.039 again
00:59:29.079 then with a trembling hand he touched
00:59:32.319 her
00:59:33.599 cheek immediately the warmth and color
00:59:36.760 of Life returned to
00:59:38.010 [Music]
00:59:43.039 her the king immediately fell on his
00:59:45.400 knees weeping with joy he embraced the
00:59:48.079 dear child
00:59:49.760 tenderly oh my Zoe my Zoe he cried I
00:59:53.799 have found my dear Zoey
00:59:57.039 and what the king said was quite true
00:59:59.960 for indeed he
01:00:01.880 [Music]
01:00:11.880 had that day King Midas called a large
01:00:17.400 Feast it was a celebration unlike
01:00:20.119 anything the world had ever seen even to
01:00:22.440 this
01:00:24.000 day every L was empty and nothing was
01:00:26.799 spared not a single thing for you see
01:00:29.559 there was no earthly extravagance that
01:00:32.119 could match King midas's love for his
01:00:44.079 daughter and when the celebration was
01:00:46.240 over and everyone had gone home King
01:00:49.000 Midas instructed his servants to gather
01:00:51.680 up all the golden coins in the treasury
01:00:54.319 and bring them to the castle par
01:00:57.079 it and there as the sun dipped Beyond
01:01:00.599 the Horizon he and his Zoe his beloved
01:01:05.559 Zoe tossed them out over the water one
01:01:09.960 by
01:01:11.440 one and one by one each of the golden
01:01:16.480 coins was
01:01:18.520 transformed into a beautiful white
01:01:22.160 butterfly that flew up and up
01:01:26.599 and
01:01:27.640 up into the Magnificent Blue
