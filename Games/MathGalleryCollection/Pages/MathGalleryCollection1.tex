Mars the Moose: That's my specialty.

Ginger: The weather report calls for a 50\% chance of falling skies this weekend. We need to build the museum and get it glazed as soon as possible.

Female Dog (Maxine): A one, a two, a one, two, two, three, four!

Male Dogs (Singing): Words are floating through my mind every minute of the day. Melodies and harmonies sing out but I wanna say. Now everything adds up, yes everything adds up. Every song that I prepared to conveys the dreams I love to share.

Space Port Operator: Gracie, did you make the sign?

Gracie: I thought you'd never ask.
