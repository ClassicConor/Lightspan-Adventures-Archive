00:00:43.600 
00:00:48.719 take one underperforming school
00:00:51.360 we were on a downhill
00:00:53.760 shoot
00:00:55.120 mix in a committed administration
00:01:04.000 pat came here
00:01:06.159 with a commitment to
00:01:09.280 teaching all children well
00:01:13.040 blend in some innovative teaching
00:01:14.799 techniques
00:01:16.320 and a reinvigorated staff
00:01:18.479 because that's the area that that
00:01:20.560 connects the result is one of the
00:01:22.479 highest achieving schools in the city of
00:01:24.560 seattle
00:01:25.759 the alki elementary school
00:01:33.650 
00:01:52.200 
00:01:52.450 
00:01:54.640 it's 60 miles to the south
00:01:56.960 yet mount rainier somehow dominates the
00:01:59.200 seattle skyline
00:02:00.960 the man-made office tower seems small by
00:02:03.360 comparison
00:02:04.960 in this city on the puget sound the
00:02:07.360 commitment to education starts at the
00:02:09.520 very top when you look at the
00:02:11.200 performance of the city of seattle mayor
00:02:13.760 norman rice took office in 1990 and
00:02:16.400 convened an education summit that
00:02:18.239 included the business community
00:02:20.000 educators and ordinary citizens
00:02:23.680 and he asked seattle residents to
00:02:25.360 approve a special tax
00:02:27.760 the money would be earmarked for
00:02:29.120 education
00:02:30.640 in the middle of a recession the voters
00:02:32.959 overwhelmingly said
00:02:34.840 yes really it's in my self-interest
00:02:37.599 people choose to live in the city for
00:02:39.280 about three different reasons one
00:02:41.360 education two public safety three the
00:02:44.160 amenities so if i want people to stay in
00:02:47.440 my city come to my city live in this
00:02:49.760 city education has to be a high priority
00:02:52.480 of this mayor and so it's one that's
00:02:54.319 going to be there for the long term that
00:02:56.400 priority is exemplified by an elementary
00:02:58.879 school that serves the working class
00:03:00.640 community of west seattle
00:03:03.200 the neighborhood is called alki
00:03:06.239 the school is alki elementary
00:03:09.519 not long ago al-qaeda exemplified
00:03:11.920 something else altogether
00:03:14.480 pat sander was named principal four
00:03:16.400 years ago
00:03:18.159 during her first month on the job a
00:03:20.400 newspaper article listed al kai as one
00:03:22.640 of the 20 worst schools in seattle
00:03:26.239 well probably the best thing that
00:03:27.680 happened for me was that the scores had
00:03:29.599 been falling and the newspaper article
00:03:31.680 came out
00:03:32.799 because it gave
00:03:35.120 the parents the staff and myself a place
00:03:37.360 to rally around that was an objective
00:03:39.440 place that we needed to make a
00:03:41.200 difference and do something different
00:03:42.560 for children
00:03:49.440 took over a school in which almost half
00:03:51.519 the students are children of immigrants
00:03:53.840 mostly from southeast asia and mexico
00:03:57.760 visit the lunchroom and you'll hear 20
00:04:00.159 different languages and dialects
00:04:10.480 in addition a majority of students
00:04:12.799 qualify for free or reduced lunch
00:04:16.560 but pat santa expected academic
00:04:18.880 excellence and demanded the same from
00:04:21.279 her teaching staff
00:04:23.680 what i did was actually start to focus
00:04:25.840 on the instructional act i'm a firm
00:04:28.240 believer that if you can get the
00:04:29.440 instruction and the instructional act
00:04:31.360 going in the right direction that some
00:04:33.440 of the other things will come along that
00:04:35.600 student self-image increases as they
00:04:37.440 find that they're being successful
00:04:46.960 one of pat sanders first moves was to
00:04:49.280 get the non-english speaking students
00:04:51.199 into regular classrooms as quickly as
00:04:53.360 possible
00:04:58.080 we've tried to do an immersion more
00:05:00.000 technique
00:05:02.400 and
00:05:03.280 instead of having those children pulled
00:05:05.280 out where they're in a room with other
00:05:07.520 children that are speaking the
00:05:08.720 conglomerations of languages and
00:05:10.560 dialects
00:05:11.840 we have looked at instructional
00:05:14.160 placements that are appropriate to them
00:05:16.400 and mainstream them in with the rest of
00:05:18.240 the children and so consequently the
00:05:20.479 english language then
00:05:22.080 seems to take off much more quickly with
00:05:24.560 those children
00:05:35.199 what you can do is type in the list of
00:05:36.800 words on the crossword magic the same
00:05:39.520 approach applies to children with
00:05:41.120 learning disabilities or physical
00:05:42.880 handicaps
00:05:44.400 they spend a small part of the day with
00:05:46.320 special ed teacher tovi andvik
00:05:49.199 or in individual instruction
00:05:52.820 
00:05:54.080 but the majority of their time is spent
00:05:56.080 in regular classrooms
00:05:58.639 they need to be in class they will learn
00:06:01.039 more by learning from their peers and
00:06:03.280 from their teachers and by learning how
00:06:05.520 to use
00:06:06.400 the textbooks and how to listen and how
00:06:08.479 to take notes
00:06:09.919 not only was there a major effort to get
00:06:12.160 everyone in the mainstream the
00:06:14.080 mainstream itself was radically
00:06:16.080 restructured
00:06:17.280 alki and some other seattle schools
00:06:19.520 follow the early childhood model
00:06:22.080 an idea pioneered by louise mckinney who
00:06:25.120 directs the office of academic
00:06:26.800 achievement in our early childhood model
00:06:29.680 schools
00:06:30.880 we do not believe in a cage for every
00:06:34.080 age
00:06:35.600 and so we say taught at an appropriate
00:06:37.440 level of instruction in other words at
00:06:39.199 an appropriate instructional level for
00:06:41.280 every child which might might not be
00:06:43.840 grade level appropriate so
00:06:46.479 we organize the curriculum
00:06:48.479 so that it is not grade leveled
00:06:52.080 second and third graders are grouped
00:06:53.759 together in what's called the primary
00:06:55.680 level
00:06:57.440 fourth and fifth graders at the
00:06:58.880 intermediate level
00:07:00.880 there's less emphasis on what grade a
00:07:02.960 child is in
00:07:04.400 more emphasis on how well a child is
00:07:06.720 learning
00:07:08.479 i try and get into the classrooms every
00:07:10.160 day and monitor what's going on in there
00:07:13.039 we move the children as they need to be
00:07:14.800 moved through the frequent monitoring if
00:07:17.280 we start to assess that a child's taking
00:07:19.120 a growth spurt in education then we'll
00:07:21.680 move them to a group that's more
00:07:23.599 appropriate to them if we find out that
00:07:25.280 maybe they've slowed down a little bit
00:07:26.800 and the group that they're with
00:07:28.479 is moving at a faster pace
00:07:30.720 then we'll move the child again so it's
00:07:33.280 not a tracking system once they're put
00:07:35.120 into a group but we monitor that and
00:07:37.280 watch where they're going
00:07:39.199 but the early childhood model is more
00:07:41.280 than just ungraded classrooms
00:07:43.680 it's an entire philosophy
00:07:45.840 the learning of the child is what
00:07:47.840 matters
00:07:48.879 but you see there was a time
00:07:50.960 when this nation wasn't called upon to
00:07:53.199 educate all of its children
00:07:55.199 we were called upon to educate the
00:07:57.199 leaders which were about 20
00:07:59.360 of our student population and then we
00:08:01.680 had to educate about 30
00:08:04.080 of of our student population to assist
00:08:06.639 that 20 percent and the rest of the
00:08:08.000 folks could go into factories or they
00:08:09.919 could be throwaways but in this
00:08:11.919 information age
00:08:14.319 all of that has changed there are no
00:08:16.319 factories for the 50 percent to go into
00:08:19.520 this is a day where all children must
00:08:22.560 learn all children must be able to be
00:08:26.160 fully employed all of our children have
00:08:29.120 to become thinking individuals because
00:08:31.599 they're no rote memory kinds of job for
00:08:33.919 just hard working
00:08:35.919 people who aren't able to think
00:08:38.159 in a critical way yes yes would someone
00:08:41.440 like to make an analogy from elephants
00:08:43.599 and tusks to something that's happened
00:08:45.920 the overriding belief at alki is that
00:08:48.399 all students can learn not only the
00:08:50.320 basic skills
00:08:51.680 they can also learn to be critical
00:08:53.600 thinkers great
00:08:55.120 oh yes colleen dumas class is one
00:08:57.760 example
00:08:58.959 in this exercise called private eye kids
00:09:02.080 look at a magnified image of an everyday
00:09:04.320 object
00:09:05.440 then draw what they see i see some great
00:09:09.600 drawings and now i want to see some
00:09:11.600 great analogies
00:09:13.200 the analogies are intended to stretch
00:09:15.360 the imagination
00:09:17.040 i think i did a silver dollar and it
00:09:19.360 reminded me of an eyeball
00:09:23.360 definitely
00:09:25.680 here a geography map
00:09:28.720 so this is a butterfly and she writes
00:09:30.640 that it reminds her of a geography map
00:09:34.240 great thinking analogies showing
00:09:36.880 relationship is an important skill
00:09:40.080 well it reminds me of how involved
00:09:43.120 i'm finding that the analogies and their
00:09:45.600 ability to see relationship
00:09:47.680 transfers
00:09:49.519 it transfers into their science into
00:09:51.440 their social studies it integrates the
00:09:54.320 curriculum more now you remember the
00:09:56.480 things we were going to write about the
00:09:58.080 idea of an integrated curriculum is in
00:10:00.480 evidence throughout alki
00:10:02.720 the theme in fred pruitt's class is the
00:10:04.800 tropical rainforest do you remember
00:10:06.480 what's one thing we're worried about
00:10:08.560 earth our home
00:10:10.240 about all the pollution and one day the
00:10:12.560 um the earth might just die and all the
00:10:16.160 trees will die and all the animals will
00:10:18.640 die all right
00:10:20.320 he uses that theme to teach not only
00:10:22.480 science and geography but also language
00:10:25.200 and spelling
00:10:26.720 what kind of dreams are
00:10:31.040 when the class breaks into groups the
00:10:33.279 students are asked to compose a letter
00:10:35.120 about the rainforest
00:10:38.959 would you start it with i think
00:10:41.279 i think that people
00:10:43.920 are
00:10:45.680 cutting down too much trees too many
00:10:48.079 trees write it i like that
00:10:51.120 you're stating a concern
00:10:53.360 later in the week the integration even
00:10:55.600 extends to mathematics how would you
00:10:58.720 shade away four fifths
00:11:01.600 of all the old growth forest just use
00:11:04.320 that one i'm going to be with these
00:11:05.680 children from one year and my goal is to
00:11:09.120 help them want to learn and to learn as
00:11:11.600 much as they can in that one year
00:11:13.200 because they're not going to get that
00:11:14.800 chance again
00:11:16.079 okay money equation for 18 and while
00:11:18.320 we're waiting for her to get it together
00:11:20.160 robert yode the integrated curriculum
00:11:22.320 starts early at alki
00:11:24.560 diane tompkinson teaches first graders
00:11:27.440 she's known for making the most of every
00:11:29.519 minute in the classroom
00:11:31.600 an example is calendar math
00:11:34.160 it's the 18th day of the month
00:11:36.480 a perfect opportunity to work with the
00:11:38.560 number 18.
00:11:40.079 christina can we have an equation from
00:11:41.600 you please
00:11:43.839 14
00:11:48.079 plus
00:11:49.519 nice loud voice so i can hear you
00:11:51.839 four
00:11:52.720 equals 18.
00:11:54.399 excellent that might give our painters
00:11:56.560 something to go on another technique is
00:11:58.800 called story painter
00:12:00.880 while diane tompkinson reads a story two
00:12:03.920 children paint their vision of what the
00:12:05.680 story's all about
00:12:08.399 you get a lot better listening skills
00:12:10.800 when they try to imagine
00:12:12.959 what is going on in the story and
00:12:14.399 particularly when they know they're
00:12:15.440 going to have an opportunity to paint
00:12:17.200 their favorite part and that we are
00:12:19.360 going to work with a story and describe
00:12:22.079 that chapter our purpose for this
00:12:24.320 morning is to talk a little bit about
00:12:26.240 writing when an idea like story painter
00:12:28.880 proves effective it's passed on to the
00:12:31.200 rest of the staff and the entire
00:12:32.959 district chapter one joan dorr is a
00:12:35.440 staff development specialist from the
00:12:37.200 office of academic achievement
00:12:39.920 in this session she reads a story while
00:12:42.560 al-qaid teachers do the painting
00:12:45.440 the cat was very drippy
00:12:48.320 i'd like you to think of some
00:12:50.839 variations what could you what else
00:12:53.279 could you do with this idea
00:12:55.680 sound effects
00:12:58.160 you know while you're reading the story
00:13:00.000 you know the kid that makes the great
00:13:01.440 airplane noise can be the airplane and
00:13:03.920 it's a lot of fun they like doing that
00:13:05.920 you can do sounds or you could do mine
00:13:09.120 wonderful this is one element in a
00:13:11.200 continual search
00:13:12.880 a search for new and better ways to
00:13:14.959 teach anything else the more strategies
00:13:17.839 and methods you have the more children
00:13:19.360 you reach
00:13:20.399 and the more interesting it becomes
00:13:22.480 and i think that's a key thing we're
00:13:23.760 finding nowadays is letting children
00:13:26.240 know there is more than one path to the
00:13:28.560 house
00:13:29.760 and they're all acceptable and
00:13:31.760 appropriate and so that you have
00:13:34.160 children taking risks in learning
00:13:36.959 you're missing a part
00:13:39.360 and the part that you're missing in this
00:13:41.279 class laurie eba and diane tompkinson
00:13:44.000 are teaching their first graders about
00:13:45.680 sea life
00:13:46.880 they're about to take a field trip to
00:13:48.399 the beach sat down and tried to study
00:13:51.279 this beach creature what did you find
00:13:54.160 out about it the first step is getting
00:13:56.000 the students ready to learn and it's a
00:13:57.920 beach creature do you think we need
00:14:00.480 we need to know a lot more to become
00:14:02.160 beachologists yeah
00:14:04.240 okay do you think our trip to the beach
00:14:06.079 tomorrow is going to be something that
00:14:08.000 we're really going to learn a lot of
00:14:09.600 things on yeah
00:14:12.160 remember we counted them how many does
00:14:14.079 it happen it has the next day they're
00:14:16.480 off on the field trip
00:14:18.240 50 first graders newly certified as
00:14:21.120 beachologists can you see the two feats
00:14:25.600 i found some kind of um starfish you
00:14:27.920 were talking about the purple one
00:14:30.560 oh i see it what do you see
00:14:34.480 those red things
00:14:44.079 attach to the rocks with all these two
00:14:46.079 feet and they become totally engrossed
00:14:48.240 in what it is that they're doing
00:14:50.240 and
00:14:51.199 the motivation is there the the feeling
00:14:53.680 that god we want to learn all we can
00:14:55.839 about it
00:14:58.320 and
00:14:59.279 it just seems to create
00:15:02.480 a feeling in them that they
00:15:04.639 they can do it and they want to do it
00:15:06.720 and it has meaning to them and i think
00:15:08.720 that's the whole point of what we're
00:15:11.279 doing for kids is to create meaning for
00:15:13.600 them
00:15:14.480 later in the week the students use
00:15:16.480 language arts and spelling to put
00:15:18.399 together their own books about the field
00:15:20.320 trip
00:15:21.120 and their study of science continues as
00:15:23.279 well see how the clam
00:15:25.600 christine see how the clam is sitting
00:15:27.839 like this and this is where it's
00:15:29.279 connected this week filled with learning
00:15:31.759 was due partly to the parents of these
00:15:33.759 children
00:15:34.880 some of whom went along on the field
00:15:36.560 trip to help supervise this patch right
00:15:38.959 here it's big and round
00:15:41.279 then it's a female it sounds like we
00:15:42.800 could and the role of parents at alki
00:15:45.120 goes far beyond field trips
00:15:47.519 parents had a real strong opinion about
00:15:49.279 how the computer should be used
00:15:51.440 as part of the accelerated schools model
00:15:53.839 developed at stanford university
00:15:56.560 the model calls for a site management
00:15:58.800 council somewhat analogous to a board of
00:16:01.279 directors
00:16:03.120 the council includes the principal staff
00:16:05.440 members and four parents one of those
00:16:08.639 parents
00:16:09.600 bill stahlzer is the chairman
00:16:12.560 we have the power to make decisions in
00:16:14.639 the school about what will happen in
00:16:16.320 this school we as a site council have
00:16:18.800 decided that our role will not be
00:16:21.040 advisory but in fact that we will make
00:16:23.519 decisions about what happens at the
00:16:25.120 school consistent with district policy
00:16:27.040 from the staff's point of view though we
00:16:28.639 would want instruction so that's the
00:16:30.720 recommendation that's coming here so
00:16:32.079 we're going to go from halftime science
00:16:34.000 this year to full time next year in
00:16:35.920 addition to serving as chairman of the
00:16:37.680 site management council
00:16:39.440 bill stahlser also reorganized the
00:16:41.600 computer room at alki
00:16:43.920 i can make a difference
00:16:45.440 and parents can make a difference at the
00:16:47.199 school i would say probably of the 330
00:16:50.800 something children in the school last
00:16:52.320 year 250 to 300 of them
00:16:55.199 uh were on the computer you know
00:16:58.000 every week at least once or twice okay
00:17:00.240 and that happened because of parents
00:17:03.040 okay because of my helping get it
00:17:04.480 started and and there were parents down
00:17:06.160 here supervising me so because the staff
00:17:08.000 that we don't have staff to do it you
00:17:09.760 know staff doesn't have extra time we
00:17:11.199 couldn't get a specialist
00:17:12.880 so it was done
00:17:14.079 with parents
00:17:16.559 another parent on the site management
00:17:18.400 council is knee hull a native of
00:17:20.959 cambodia who came to america in 1975.
00:17:25.599 this is the first time that i heard side
00:17:27.679 counsel have
00:17:29.840 a parents who are minority to be part of
00:17:32.160 it especially like me is who's refugees
00:17:34.880 and speak broken english to be part of
00:17:36.880 it you know all the school i heard that
00:17:40.400 did not even want to hear what the
00:17:42.160 parent had to say
00:17:43.840 nihal's daughter is at the intermediate
00:17:45.919 level at alki he speaks for her and for
00:17:49.039 all the other children of refugees
00:17:51.600 it's very important that all of us must
00:17:54.000 work together be open mind and try to
00:17:56.400 understand each other
00:17:57.919 so when i
00:17:59.280 involved in this one not just only psych
00:18:01.520 counsel i try to someone say well you
00:18:04.080 know telling them about my culture and
00:18:06.559 all the people culture so then we can
00:18:08.799 try to understand each other and can
00:18:10.320 work well together you know rather than
00:18:12.880 i hate that person but i never talk to
00:18:14.960 that person you see before we hate
00:18:17.039 someone and disclose someone and
00:18:18.640 understand that person before we hit
00:18:20.160 them
00:18:21.520 throughout alki there's an obvious
00:18:23.760 respect for the many different cultures
00:18:25.760 that come together here at the same time
00:18:29.360 the overall goal is to give these
00:18:31.360 children the tools they'll need to
00:18:33.120 succeed in their new country
00:18:37.490 
00:18:45.600 let us tell you how we do
00:18:50.559 you have given us
00:18:55.780 
00:19:02.880 four years after al-qaeda was named one
00:19:04.960 of the worst schools in seattle it's now
00:19:07.760 among the best
00:19:09.679 al qaeda is well above the district
00:19:11.600 average in math and reading
00:19:14.080 and despite the bilingual population
00:19:16.720 the school equals the district average
00:19:18.720 in language arts
00:19:20.960 pat sander feels the same thing can be
00:19:22.960 achieved anywhere you take the group of
00:19:25.039 people you find the unity of purpose you
00:19:27.679 take the empowerment and you build on
00:19:29.360 the strengths and in no two places are
00:19:31.840 they going to be the same so you take a
00:19:34.160 look at what's the best of what's out
00:19:36.000 there that you know
00:19:37.440 and you look at what's going to work
00:19:39.200 with the people that you're working with
00:19:40.720 in the student population that you have
00:19:43.760 and you figure out as a facilitator how
00:19:46.240 to make that happen in the school that
00:19:48.160 you're at
00:19:51.600 across the water from alki there's
00:19:54.160 another remarkable elementary school
00:19:56.080 that's in the middle of a dramatic
00:19:57.760 turnaround
00:19:59.679 three years ago the beacon hill school
00:20:02.080 ranked near the bottom of all seattle
00:20:04.240 schools
00:20:07.120 it's now above the district average in
00:20:09.200 math and catching up quickly in reading
00:20:11.360 and language arts
00:20:13.600 not coincidentally
00:20:15.440 beacon hill's improvement began when
00:20:17.600 gary tubbs took over as principal one
00:20:20.080 two three let me just check the point
00:20:22.240 this is my 17th year i've never seen a
00:20:24.640 child who can't learn
00:20:26.640 and i've worked with special education
00:20:28.880 children i've worked with
00:20:30.559 children of all
00:20:31.760 poverty and affluent levels those
00:20:34.240 children can learn too we just haven't
00:20:36.720 in some cases found the right
00:20:38.559 combination to enable them
00:20:41.919 one quarter of beacon hill students are
00:20:44.000 white
00:20:45.520 most of the rest are either black or
00:20:47.360 asian and 71 percent are on free or
00:20:50.559 reduced lunch status like alki
00:20:53.679 beacon hill follows the early childhood
00:20:55.760 model which means children aren't given
00:20:58.240 labels
00:20:59.679 the rationale behind not labeling
00:21:01.840 children is that the labels seem to
00:21:03.840 stick people are very comfortable with
00:21:05.760 labels for one reason or another and
00:21:08.159 people have done so out of the goodness
00:21:09.679 of their heart we'll put all these kids
00:21:11.120 together and we'll give them all the
00:21:12.480 special attention so they can catch up
00:21:14.320 to the mainstream it doesn't happen the
00:21:16.720 gap widens it's keeping them in the
00:21:18.640 mainstream and supporting them
00:21:20.960 in any ways they need to be supported so
00:21:22.640 that it can be successful in the
00:21:23.760 mainstream that actually gets them
00:21:25.840 closer to
00:21:27.200 surviving in an independent manner in
00:21:28.960 the mainstream we used the computer here
00:21:31.200 for tool and we started to think okay at
00:21:33.760 beacon hill students are grouped by
00:21:36.080 grade level in the way that's common to
00:21:38.400 most elementary schools
00:21:40.799 who designs your robots and your
00:21:42.480 inventions but there's an uncommon
00:21:44.240 priority placed on high-level thinking
00:21:47.919 gretchen jacobson has her class form
00:21:50.320 fictitious companies to invent new
00:21:52.320 products your company's name is the
00:21:53.840 changing car company all right do you
00:21:56.080 think adults could use that
00:21:58.080 these are third graders but they're
00:22:00.240 learning about concepts like marketing
00:22:02.159 and advertising
00:22:03.600 not a real car can you tell it what to
00:22:05.520 change into yeah there's like three
00:22:07.520 little buttons a very small percentage
00:22:10.080 of a child's time spent in school
00:22:11.679 especially in the urban setting
00:22:13.760 you know that makes some sense there
00:22:15.679 it's really important to get as much as
00:22:18.320 you can in there
00:22:19.919 in depth not coverage but in depth and
00:22:22.720 by
00:22:23.600 and by doing the things i do in my
00:22:26.000 classroom i'm pulling the outside world
00:22:27.440 and integrating it in i feel as if i'm
00:22:30.480 you know i'm i'm getting a lot in there
00:22:32.480 they're still learning their basic
00:22:33.919 skills but they're seeing the
00:22:35.360 connections there
00:22:36.640 now who is your target audience who's
00:22:38.080 going to use a the local business
00:22:40.240 community is encouraged to lend a hand
00:22:43.200 davindra chainani works for the software
00:22:45.600 giant microsoft he devotes a few hours
00:22:48.960 each week to work with gretchen
00:22:50.720 jacobson's children
00:23:04.159 what i want for my kids is for them to
00:23:07.440 it feels if they have some control over
00:23:09.520 their fate
00:23:10.640 so good so right that people with broken
00:23:12.480 legs and arms that they really can make
00:23:14.880 things move and be a self-starter and an
00:23:17.039 independent learner and i think if you
00:23:19.039 can teach
00:23:20.960 youngsters to be independent learner
00:23:23.600 then that's going to carry them through
00:23:24.720 the rest of their life and they're going
00:23:25.840 to find success
00:23:27.760 at any level
00:23:31.280 gary tubbs believes every child can
00:23:33.679 learn
00:23:34.640 and much of his time is devoted to
00:23:36.480 making sure that happens
00:23:39.679 self-esteem for the child
00:23:42.880 once a week he convenes a child study
00:23:45.039 team to talk about special situations
00:23:48.159 the team tries to solve any problems
00:23:50.400 that stand in the way of a child's
00:23:52.240 learning
00:23:53.919 we'll work specifically
00:23:55.520 with jamie
00:23:57.039 on getting friendships within the
00:23:58.960 classroom so that at least for the
00:24:00.960 remainder of this year she has a sense
00:24:02.640 of of friendship all of us want to get
00:24:04.960 along he's also devoted to maintaining
00:24:07.360 discipline any conflicts but when
00:24:09.120 conflicts do come up we need to handle
00:24:11.200 them because you're going to have
00:24:12.080 conflicts throughout your whole life
00:24:15.360 and you need to know you need to have
00:24:16.799 the skills sometimes it's done in a
00:24:18.320 group handle those conflicts when they
00:24:20.000 do come up school is not a happy place
00:24:22.080 when you don't have friends sometimes
00:24:24.320 one-on-one but you have to work on that
00:24:26.240 too if you're going to insult people
00:24:28.640 if you're going to tell vaughn something
00:24:30.080 bad about her mother do you think
00:24:31.360 vaughn's going to want to be your friend
00:24:33.679 doesn't make any sense at all
00:24:36.159 do you owe toothy an apology
00:24:38.320 do you have on an apology i already gave
00:24:40.400 her heart
00:24:41.279 for apology
00:24:42.880 behavior that is disruptive to
00:24:45.279 that interferes with the teachers
00:24:46.480 teaching or interviews interferes with
00:24:48.400 other children's learning needs to be
00:24:50.480 dealt with immediately and specifically
00:24:52.880 and fairly and lovingly and it's not
00:24:55.760 just one person's job again it's one of
00:24:57.760 those dynamics of a successful school
00:25:00.080 that everybody works together
00:25:01.919 will everybody please click on your
00:25:04.159 brains this principle also likes to lead
00:25:07.120 by example and tries to teach as often
00:25:09.840 as possible this is where the action is
00:25:11.919 going to be i have a real hard time
00:25:14.960 right now because i'm leading people
00:25:17.279 down a path that i haven't been myself
00:25:19.760 it keeps my skills sharp so that i can
00:25:21.679 be a better supervisor for the teachers
00:25:23.520 on my staff
00:25:24.799 it raises my level of credibility with
00:25:27.120 the staff because i'm willing to get up
00:25:28.559 and teach at a moment's notice and work
00:25:30.240 with their kids and get right down on
00:25:32.159 the carpet with the kids and
00:25:34.080 and
00:25:35.679 i'm able to then go in and evaluate a
00:25:37.679 difficult situation because i've been
00:25:39.600 there myself
00:25:40.799 when gary tubbs arrived at beacon hill
00:25:43.360 he drew up an action plan that detailed
00:25:45.760 where the school was
00:25:47.520 and where he expected it to go we turned
00:25:50.159 it into a different kind of lunch my
00:25:52.799 role as a principal is to keep the dream
00:25:54.400 alive in the school and that's one of
00:25:56.000 the reasons for the action plan
00:25:57.919 is to be the cheerleader and it's not
00:26:00.000 just putting the vision down on a piece
00:26:01.440 of paper and saying now we have a vision
00:26:03.360 is truly believing in it and and truly
00:26:06.000 having it in your heart as well as in
00:26:08.000 your head that you live it every day and
00:26:10.400 it becomes where all of your energy goes
00:26:12.400 you continually work to channel a
00:26:15.120 greater percentage of your energy into
00:26:17.279 that vision
00:26:18.640 you got a partner
00:26:21.600 you guys were shooting out there for
00:26:24.799 working in there's two of you gary tubbs
00:26:27.120 at beacon hill closer to the basket next
00:26:29.039 time
00:26:32.799 pat sander at alki
00:26:36.080 they've led their schools to higher
00:26:37.919 levels than most people thought possible
00:26:42.080 not one of us can do it alone the
00:26:43.600 parents know certainly the most about
00:26:45.440 their children they know more than we do
00:26:48.080 okay trevor simpson let's see this now
00:26:50.960 the staff brings that educational
00:26:53.679 background and professional experience
00:26:56.320 the curriculum and instruction
00:26:58.640 and hopefully i bring the administrative
00:27:01.679 background that that can maybe pull it
00:27:03.760 all together
00:27:05.679 in other words
00:27:07.039 running an effective school is kind of
00:27:08.960 like jumping rope
00:27:10.480 it requires exquisite teamwork
00:27:15.760 it also requires a clear vision
00:27:18.480 and a leader who is never quite
00:27:20.480 satisfied
00:27:22.159 as soon as it looks like you're getting
00:27:24.159 to your vision i think your vision
00:27:25.919 becomes clarified and you
00:27:28.000 it's further away than you even thought
00:27:29.679 it could possibly be
00:27:31.440 but that in itself is is progress
00:27:35.039 despite its magnificent setting
00:27:37.520 seattle faces most of the same problems
00:27:39.919 that plague other american cities
00:27:43.760 one way out
00:27:45.039 perhaps the only way
00:27:46.960 is through superior education for every
00:27:49.600 child
00:27:51.679 i think that if education system doesn't
00:27:54.480 speak to all of our citizens then it is
00:27:56.960 not a a good education system and i
00:28:00.000 think what we believe in very strongly
00:28:02.480 is every child can learn
00:28:04.559 and if we put them in the right
00:28:06.000 environment and give them the right
00:28:07.200 support around them those children can
00:28:09.120 learn as well as anybody and that's what
00:28:11.520 we're out to prove and that's what we're
00:28:13.039 proving
00:28:14.000 all those feet sticking to it
00:28:16.880 this color is just like the rocks itself
00:28:19.200 so it's hard to see isn't it and two
00:28:21.279 elementary schools alki and beacon hill
00:28:24.640 are leading the way
00:28:26.080 what'd you find
00:28:27.600 you found a kite both schools are
00:28:30.159 shining examples of what can happen when
00:28:32.960 an entire community decides that
00:28:35.360 education
00:28:37.679 is truly the key to the city
00:28:43.890 
00:29:19.760 so




00:29:41.890 
00:29:46.320 from a distance it's a shining city
00:29:50.000 but look to the south and dallas loses
00:29:52.080 its
00:29:52.840 luster this is the city's underside not
00:29:56.399 just geographically
00:29:59.190 
00:30:01.360 unemployment crime drugs
00:30:05.360 south dallas is home to all the familiar
00:30:07.520 urban diseases
00:30:09.750 
00:30:12.320 but amid the poverty amid the
00:30:14.559 hopelessness
00:30:15.840 there sits an oasis in south dallas okay
00:30:18.880 this group your sixes one two
00:30:29.890 
00:30:33.520 very good this group seven
00:30:36.920 
00:30:53.180 
00:30:53.750 
00:30:55.760 walk into the charles rice learning
00:30:57.440 center and it's the first thing you
00:30:58.880 notice
00:30:59.840 the trophy case
00:31:01.679 the awards aren't for athletics but for
00:31:04.240 academics
00:31:05.919 and above the trophies a portrait of the
00:31:08.240 person most responsible
00:31:10.480 louise smith
00:31:14.799 louise smith was named principal in
00:31:16.720 1984.
00:31:18.399 she took over a school that was in a
00:31:20.320 word mediocre sometimes a lot of these
00:31:23.679 schools are comfortable with their level
00:31:25.519 where they are they are comfortable with
00:31:27.120 mediocrity and i'm very uncomfortable
00:31:29.840 with mediocrity if i find people who are
00:31:32.640 satisfied with mediocrity then i stay
00:31:35.039 away from them because
00:31:37.039 that that's my
00:31:38.480 discomfort zone when i see people who
00:31:41.039 are dissatisfied with just status quo
00:31:44.080 status quo at charles rice was under
00:31:46.720 achieving teachers underachieving
00:31:49.039 students
00:31:50.159 which surprised almost no one
00:31:53.039 not much is expected from schools in
00:31:54.960 south dallas and not much is expected
00:31:57.360 from students
00:31:58.960 kids from this area they are the ones
00:32:01.360 who fill up the jails
00:32:03.200 this is the highest crime rate
00:32:05.919 area in dallas
00:32:08.159 drug houses abound and the children all
00:32:10.480 know where the dope houses are they can
00:32:13.200 drive down the street and point to you
00:32:15.120 this is the dope house so this is the
00:32:16.480 dope house despite the crime
00:32:18.880 despite the drugs
00:32:20.399 louise smith set a goal of academic
00:32:22.640 excellence
00:32:24.030 
00:32:28.960 charles rice had been designated as a
00:32:30.720 learning center
00:32:32.000 still
00:32:33.120 that meant more funds for facilities and
00:32:35.279 equipment that's one of the things i
00:32:36.480 want you to look for today but turning a
00:32:39.120 school around required more than just
00:32:41.360 money money definitely is not the answer
00:32:45.519 it's not the building
00:32:47.279 it's not the
00:32:48.880 materials that you have in the building
00:32:50.960 it's the people
00:32:52.960 it's the people within the buildings
00:32:55.519 that make it work
00:32:58.159 or not
00:32:59.679 do you think we can make lamont trade
00:33:01.279 anyway
00:33:02.799 all right so step one was finding the
00:33:05.120 right people
00:33:06.320 namely dedicated teachers
00:33:08.480 this is gail mcveigh's sixth grade
00:33:10.320 social studies class
00:33:12.240 the students are learning about barter
00:33:13.840 in ancient africa
00:33:15.360 using some modern materials no calories
00:33:18.080 no cholesterol
00:33:21.120 i tried to use juggle water for
00:33:24.080 all right no now why would you do that
00:33:27.039 because i need water more than eminem if
00:33:29.679 you didn't have any water you would
00:33:31.120 trade wouldn't you but what if you had
00:33:32.720 water would you trade for that jug of
00:33:34.159 water
00:33:36.080 but do you have to give her everything
00:33:37.440 you have no
00:33:39.440 what could you do
00:33:43.250 [Laughter]
00:33:48.559 gail mcveigh arrived at rice at the same
00:33:50.640 time as louise smith she is dogged in
00:33:53.600 her pursuit
00:33:55.279 of excellence she lays lays the cards on
00:33:58.000 the table when she interviews you if
00:34:00.159 you cannot
00:34:01.440 meet her ex
00:34:02.720 expectations there are no hard feelings
00:34:04.880 but
00:34:06.720 you'll have to find another place to go
00:34:08.399 i never actually had to get rid of a
00:34:10.639 teacher but
00:34:12.719 the way we were able to to get this
00:34:15.679 school on such a high standard
00:34:18.480 some teachers who came saw that they
00:34:20.879 couldn't keep up
00:34:22.399 so they asked to leave
00:34:24.480 go
00:34:26.639 step back there was also a conscious
00:34:28.480 effort to actively engage students in
00:34:30.480 learning
00:34:31.760 linda jennings fifth grade math class is
00:34:34.000 one example
00:34:35.520 the chore of reducing fractions is
00:34:37.760 turned into a game
00:34:39.599 yeah
00:34:41.520 step back
00:34:42.800 we still have a tie
00:34:45.040 look straight ahead you're waiting
00:34:46.320 around okay
00:34:48.239 come on you gotta move faster
00:34:50.639 then there was the matter of discipline
00:34:53.119 the school motto at charles rice is
00:34:55.679 excellent academics
00:34:57.440 excellent behavior
00:34:59.359 6'5
00:35:04.480 no child can learn if they're talking
00:35:06.960 when the teacher is talking they miss
00:35:08.560 out on too much
00:35:10.240 and we work on that right along with
00:35:12.560 academics we carry it both right along
00:35:15.200 together and we work on both equally and
00:35:17.040 strong
00:35:18.480 good behavior is paramount at charles
00:35:20.720 rice
00:35:21.599 a specialist is even brought into
00:35:23.119 council students
00:35:24.800 individually and as a group
00:35:27.359 you have to decide if this is the proper
00:35:30.160 behavior or if it's
00:35:32.720 improper right yes
00:35:35.040 can someone make you do something you
00:35:36.800 don't want to do no no
00:35:39.599 don't tell me why you couldn't figure
00:35:41.119 that out
00:35:44.560 more than anything else louise smith
00:35:47.280 actually expected charles rice to
00:35:49.119 achieve academic excellence
00:35:52.000 that's a term you hear often at this
00:35:53.680 school high expectations
00:35:56.640 victor washington has taught math at
00:35:58.640 rice for eight years not just a head you
00:36:01.520 multiply first then you work from left
00:36:04.000 to right okay so i would do two times
00:36:06.400 you don't expect anything out of them
00:36:07.680 then i don't give you anything but if
00:36:09.280 you push and push and push and expect
00:36:12.560 this and tell them you know i'll help
00:36:14.160 you in any way that i can then they'll
00:36:16.400 give you a lot
00:36:17.760 when you finish that you need to look
00:36:19.680 and see if this fraction can be
00:36:21.520 simplified expectations were so high the
00:36:24.640 charles wright started competing against
00:36:26.480 elementary schools throughout the
00:36:28.079 district including those from the
00:36:29.920 wealthy suburbs
00:36:32.320 equal sign
00:36:34.079 what do we get
00:36:37.200 what is eight times six too slow for
00:36:39.920 example
00:36:40.880 there's the annual math olympiad
00:36:44.800 rice students trained for the event
00:36:46.400 after school under victor washington and
00:36:49.200 irene redmond
00:36:51.200 very good eight times three
00:36:53.599 when rice first entered the math
00:36:55.119 olympiad louise smith expected nothing
00:36:58.320 less than first place
00:37:00.480 certainly certainly whenever i send kids
00:37:04.320 out from charles rice to a competition
00:37:07.280 you see i would motivate them first i
00:37:09.280 would build them up to tell them they're
00:37:11.440 going to win and then i would tell them
00:37:14.480 when they were going out that i expected
00:37:16.320 them to bring trophies back to me
00:37:19.359 but almost no one else expected much
00:37:21.280 from this inner city school
00:37:24.800 mary lester is director of mathematics
00:37:26.880 for the entire district and runs the
00:37:29.200 math olympiad tell us rice when they
00:37:31.839 first entered uh they were so confident
00:37:34.079 that they would win said we chose rice
00:37:36.240 uh you know no
00:37:38.160 they're not going to win and yet they
00:37:41.359 persisted and each year that year they
00:37:43.920 did win some individual fierce place
00:37:46.160 awards and since then they become a
00:37:48.640 power to be recognized in the city and
00:37:51.839 people don't take charge right slightly
00:37:53.920 anymore
00:37:56.640 i just like to prove to people that my
00:37:58.480 kids are just as good as anyone else's
00:38:00.320 and they can win which they have all the
00:38:02.640 time so they can win doesn't matter what
00:38:04.800 color they are you know they can win and
00:38:07.040 they can compete with
00:38:08.880 hispanic kids white kids or whatever
00:38:11.410 
00:38:17.040 the reach for excellence extended into
00:38:19.040 every subject and every activity
00:38:21.839 this is the kindergarten through third
00:38:23.760 grade choir
00:38:25.200 preparing for a tour of the east coast
00:38:30.190 
00:38:43.839 so within the course of a few years
00:38:46.000 louise smith and her teachers turned
00:38:47.839 this school into a showcase
00:38:51.280 in fact in 1986
00:38:54.560 william bennett then secretary of
00:38:56.320 education visited rice and cited it as
00:38:59.119 an example of what can be achieved in
00:39:01.200 urban education
00:39:03.280 what do we do next
00:39:05.839 among the elementary schools in dallas
00:39:08.000 charles rice ranks in the top 15 percent
00:39:10.720 in both math and language
00:39:13.200 it should start a new paragraph there
00:39:15.680 miss marilyn hello please but there's
00:39:17.760 one catch to this story louise smith is
00:39:20.640 no longer principal of charles rice
00:39:23.359 she's been promoted to area director and
00:39:25.680 is now in charge of 13 schools rice
00:39:28.720 among them
00:39:30.880 the new principal is dr geraldine hughes
00:39:33.520 a woman known for her affectionate ways
00:39:36.320 give me my hug i'm a hugger
00:39:38.640 that means that i will walk by and i'll
00:39:41.520 hug you
00:39:42.640 it's simply saying it says to staff
00:39:44.960 members that i'm concerned about you as
00:39:47.760 a person as well as as a teacher
00:39:51.200 and i hug children
00:39:52.960 on a continuing basis
00:39:55.520 too many times we don't show children
00:39:58.720 how we really feel and that hug is is my
00:40:02.000 way of showing them how i feel about
00:40:04.240 them
00:40:08.079 hugging aside this new principal brought
00:40:10.640 with her the same high expectations as
00:40:12.880 louise smith
00:40:15.359 that was the first thing she told her
00:40:17.119 teachers and students
00:40:18.880 boys and girls how many of you have your
00:40:20.720 homework packets
00:40:22.960 i simply said to them are we 100
00:40:25.119 principles have changed
00:40:27.440 but the rules have not
00:40:29.760 i believe children want
00:40:32.000 people to demand certain things of them
00:40:35.280 if i look back those persons or teachers
00:40:37.599 i remember
00:40:38.640 are those who were tough
00:40:40.880 and sometimes that's what has to happen
00:40:43.680 it has to be tough love
00:40:46.079 but we care enough for the children to
00:40:48.560 demand the very best from them
00:40:51.359 you can look around the school and see
00:40:53.040 that not much has changed
00:40:55.040 there's the same emphasis on learning
00:40:57.280 the same emphasis on good behavior
00:41:00.000 the insistence on proper behavior
00:41:01.839 extends beyond the classroom it includes
00:41:04.480 every activity associated with a school
00:41:08.400 on this day
00:41:09.680 two kindergarten classes were off on a
00:41:11.680 field trip
00:41:12.960 this was a visit to the shop that makes
00:41:14.800 all the street signs in dallas
00:41:20.880 field trips are seen as a valuable
00:41:22.640 connection to the world beyond the
00:41:24.079 borders of south dallas
00:41:26.079 so the school organizes as many as
00:41:28.079 possible
00:41:29.200 often to the symphony and other cultural
00:41:31.119 events
00:41:32.000 and no matter where rice students go
00:41:34.400 there's always a sense of discipline and
00:41:36.560 order
00:41:37.520 many different ones and that is just
00:41:39.680 fine with the parents of most of these
00:41:41.520 children
00:41:43.040 carlisa dixon for example is a fifth
00:41:45.200 grade honor student
00:41:47.440 she hopes someday to be a writer
00:41:50.400 her mother glorious who single-handedly
00:41:53.040 raised carlisa and an older son
00:41:55.520 expects her children to achieve and to
00:41:57.920 behave
00:42:07.440 i don't want kids to be disruptive in
00:42:09.599 class i don't want anybody abusing my
00:42:11.599 child but if my child gets out of line
00:42:14.560 and my child needs to be disciplined at
00:42:16.319 that particular moment yes you have my
00:42:18.000 permission to do that
00:42:19.839 and my kids know that
00:42:21.839 and then they know that if they get in
00:42:23.200 trouble then they come home and they get
00:42:24.560 in trouble again
00:42:26.000 kids have to know that parents and
00:42:28.640 teachers are working cooperatively
00:42:31.839 i mean it's all a kid needs to know
00:42:34.480 is that
00:42:36.400 one of those elements is not working in
00:42:38.319 harmony with the other one
00:42:40.240 and they're going to take advantage of
00:42:41.680 that i believe that we have to continue
00:42:45.119 to work so that first we take
00:42:47.880 responsibility for students behavior and
00:42:50.640 ultimately they take responsibility for
00:42:53.359 their own
00:42:54.640 if you could have a choice
00:42:57.760 having something made of gold but
00:43:00.640 getting a child's attention is one thing
00:43:03.280 keeping it is another
00:43:05.040 so the primary focus here is still on
00:43:07.119 one thing or top-notch instructions
00:43:10.000 having some salt
00:43:12.880 what would you choose
00:43:15.200 how many people would choose gold
00:43:17.440 if i were to look at a charles rice
00:43:19.680 teacher
00:43:20.960 and say this person portrays
00:43:23.920 what we want miss beatty supplied me
00:43:25.920 with this real interesting salt crystal
00:43:28.400 they have a love of teaching
00:43:31.440 that transcends just the regular hours
00:43:36.319 they enjoy seeing students learn
00:43:40.240 they enjoy the art of teaching
00:43:43.520 and they also know the science of
00:43:45.440 teaching touch your table
00:43:47.599 touch you
00:43:49.280 fan your hand in the air
00:43:51.520 everything you just touched is made of
00:43:54.079 matter
00:43:55.440 it has mass and it takes up space and
00:43:58.880 sometimes science specialist georgia
00:44:00.960 beatty is a perfect example
00:44:03.200 he's been a teacher for 20 years the
00:44:05.359 last eight of them at charles rice
00:44:08.400 liquids and solids we're not a textbook
00:44:11.839 oriented school where we just simply you
00:44:14.000 know start at chapter one and proceed
00:44:15.920 through chapter 14.
00:44:17.839 and there are a lot of people in
00:44:19.440 education who
00:44:21.440 were
00:44:23.280 came about
00:44:24.400 their teaching credentials that way you
00:44:26.560 know you just plod through
00:44:29.200 and we're not like that
00:44:30.880 we're very different
00:44:32.720 rice is the only elementary school in
00:44:34.720 dallas with a science specialist
00:44:37.040 it means the regular science teachers
00:44:38.880 bring their students to the lab once a
00:44:40.640 week and it means georgia beatty teaches
00:44:43.760 350 children
00:44:45.920 in this class she uses two simple
00:44:48.000 ingredients
00:44:49.119 elmer's glue and a borax solution to
00:44:52.000 make a substance that resembles silly
00:44:54.560 putty
00:44:59.119 the whole point is to teach the students
00:45:01.200 about the different properties of matter
00:45:03.680 it's
00:45:04.560 putting practical things to use whatever
00:45:07.200 they are
00:45:08.240 now why other schools don't do it well
00:45:10.640 some teachers are afraid of science
00:45:12.480 they're afraid to get dirty they're
00:45:14.000 afraid to make a mistake
00:45:15.760 they're afraid to say i don't know there
00:45:18.079 are many schools in dallas and elsewhere
00:45:20.240 where they don't teach science and you
00:45:22.800 know the kids it's one of their favorite
00:45:24.160 subjects
00:45:26.400 are you cutting that no i pulled it
00:45:28.640 quickly
00:45:29.680 and what happened
00:45:31.359 it's evident that two decades of
00:45:32.960 teaching haven't dimmed georgia beatty's
00:45:34.800 enthusiasm
00:45:36.240 when you pull on a piece of paper does
00:45:37.680 it break in a straight line seeing kids
00:45:40.240 when the light dawns ah that's what this
00:45:43.040 is seeing it come on on their own that's
00:45:46.480 exciting i like what i do and if i stop
00:45:50.160 liking it then i need to do something
00:45:52.240 else
00:45:52.520 
00:45:55.440 that love of teaching is evident
00:45:57.119 throughout charles rice
00:46:02.079 raymond greer's specialty is music but
00:46:04.400 he goes beyond that
00:46:07.520 anyone have an idea what vermicelli is
00:46:09.599 yes it's a kind of spaghetti it's a
00:46:11.760 spaghetti spaghetti dish vermicelli
00:46:14.079 there any other words
00:46:15.680 that you're not familiar with a lot of
00:46:17.599 people think that music and band and the
00:46:20.800 strings they do not assist the main
00:46:24.160 quote-unquote math science and they do
00:46:26.400 not fit in but you can teach anything
00:46:28.800 with music
00:46:30.670 
00:46:33.680 everything is aimed at producing
00:46:35.200 well-rounded students
00:46:37.040 students who are proficient in more than
00:46:38.800 just the basic skills
00:46:43.180 
00:46:52.319 it goes back to the basic philosophy
00:46:54.400 that i am here for the children
00:46:56.640 and whatever i can do
00:46:58.400 to expand their life
00:47:00.720 to expose them to new literature to new
00:47:03.200 ideas in life that are educationally
00:47:04.720 sound and it's my job that's just being
00:47:06.960 a teacher okay i need all eyes on me
00:47:09.599 firm discipline
00:47:11.119 sound teaching techniques
00:47:13.200 high expectations
00:47:15.200 strong leadership it all seems
00:47:17.280 relatively simple it is simple
00:47:20.160 it's not a unique formula
00:47:22.400 it takes
00:47:23.680 people
00:47:25.440 garnering their energies together
00:47:28.720 for this end
00:47:30.800 and the end being that you're producing
00:47:33.520 high-achieving
00:47:35.280 self-motivated
00:47:36.960 students
00:47:38.559 who you can be proud of
00:47:41.359 who can do this thing out here that they
00:47:43.760 call education good afternoon
00:47:48.640 and show me with your signals how are
00:47:50.640 you feeling today how are you feeling
00:47:52.480 all right
00:47:53.599 one program intended to produce
00:47:55.520 self-motivated students is something
00:47:57.359 called project c
00:48:00.319 a requirement for every student in
00:48:02.160 grades four through six
00:48:04.720 at first glance project seed is simply a
00:48:07.440 different way of teaching advanced
00:48:09.040 mathematics latoya unless everyone let's
00:48:11.200 read it follow my finger
00:48:14.160 a2
00:48:16.559 equals four if and only if 2 to the
00:48:20.800 power 4
00:48:22.720 16. all right but actually this is much
00:48:25.599 more than just math
00:48:27.520 william glee has been a project seed
00:48:29.599 specialist for 10 years
00:48:32.160 we use mathematics as a tool
00:48:34.960 and the two
00:48:36.400 is to
00:48:38.000 raise the self-confidence and
00:48:39.280 self-esteem you can raise their
00:48:41.040 self-esteem by teaching them how to play
00:48:43.520 chess
00:48:45.040 but when you teach them how to the
00:48:46.640 mathematics and and get them excited
00:48:48.960 about their learning education because
00:48:51.520 education is the key
00:48:53.040 for a lot of these kids to be successful
00:48:57.280 project seed instructors are all trained
00:48:59.599 mathematicians
00:49:01.680 they take turns monitoring each other's
00:49:03.839 classes
00:49:04.960 always trying to improve their teaching
00:49:08.000 and everything is taught using the
00:49:09.599 socratic method
00:49:11.200 questioning
00:49:12.319 then questioning some more
00:49:14.400 the darius
00:49:16.880 exponent is going to be
00:49:19.119 four
00:49:22.079 okay
00:49:23.040 some people say yeah some people said no
00:49:25.280 let's see what we got luanna he's a
00:49:27.839 negative four now we got but now that
00:49:30.000 wanna really disagree with that
00:49:32.319 let's see
00:49:33.280 what you like to say about it
00:49:35.040 the numerical gonna put one fourth at
00:49:37.359 the top then you're gonna put equals
00:49:39.200 four okay i'll put it here
00:49:43.359 and let's see what your classmates think
00:49:44.800 about that
00:49:46.160 all right marcus likes it jessica said
00:49:48.240 yes as for the curious hand signals
00:49:51.599 they've become almost a trademark of
00:49:53.359 project seed
00:49:55.119 when i look out to a class i see this i
00:49:57.200 know we have a few students that
00:49:58.880 disagree
00:49:59.920 but if i see students doing like this
00:50:01.760 that means i know they agree so at any
00:50:04.160 given time in the class i can see
00:50:06.240 exactly what they're thinking
00:50:08.559 i agree with that this will help us
00:50:10.240 resolve what this is so at all times i'm
00:50:12.640 more like a conductor they do all the
00:50:14.640 manipulation they do all the work they
00:50:16.640 do all the the breaking down
00:50:20.640 i just interject a question when needed
00:50:23.200 just to keep the ball rolling yeah some
00:50:26.319 another part of project seed is the
00:50:28.000 participation of the regular math
00:50:29.839 teacher
00:50:31.040 in this case victor washington
00:50:33.599 he and william glee see themselves as a
00:50:35.839 team
00:50:36.800 working toward the same goal can anybody
00:50:39.200 tell me does anybody know a power first
00:50:41.280 year i had project seed
00:50:44.079 i wasn't very happy with it then year
00:50:46.800 after year i've noticed how the kids
00:50:49.280 enjoy it
00:50:50.400 how the instructors
00:50:52.720 teach which i like a whole lot and the
00:50:55.839 kids scores are better so i say i'm sure
00:50:58.800 i'm not doing this by myself so seed
00:51:00.720 must have something to do with it and
00:51:02.319 now i welcome it all the time
00:51:04.480 project seed has been effective among
00:51:06.319 all minority students
00:51:08.400 this is a class at the ellario martinez
00:51:10.720 school in west dallas the population
00:51:13.119 here is almost entirely hispanic
00:51:16.319 who can tell us very quietly how did
00:51:18.640 roll go from this line to this number
00:51:20.800 over here what did he do to get the two
00:51:22.880 here how did he get that too marissa
00:51:24.960 bring down the two
00:51:26.720 and the plus sign
00:51:29.680 two plus zero equals two
00:51:32.480 how many groups marisa
00:51:35.200 what's two plus zero everybody
00:51:38.319 i look at the top students in all ethnic
00:51:40.960 groups
00:51:42.000 the students that start out
00:51:44.319 in the fourth grade
00:51:45.920 and the minority schools uh in the
00:51:48.800 deprived areas
00:51:50.960 when they reach middle school and high
00:51:53.200 school those top students can compete
00:51:55.599 with any type student in any school in
00:51:57.920 the nation project seed seems to
00:52:00.319 contribute to higher test scores
00:52:02.800 higher confidence is somewhat harder to
00:52:04.800 measure but it's apparent in the faces
00:52:07.119 of these students yeah this is a hard
00:52:09.280 problem they're so excited about what
00:52:11.119 they're doing they believe in what
00:52:12.800 they're doing to believe that they can
00:52:14.319 do
00:52:15.440 and it's just that that goal in their
00:52:17.440 eyes
00:52:18.480 and that that's the magic the magic
00:52:20.319 happens
00:52:21.520 with the students
00:52:23.040 and what the students see that they can
00:52:24.960 do
00:52:27.120 
00:52:32.800 charles rice is not a school without a
00:52:34.640 weakness
00:52:36.319 its achilles heel is reading
00:52:38.720 in recent years reading scores haven't
00:52:40.800 quite measured up to those in math and
00:52:42.640 language so right now the school is
00:52:44.800 trying to strengthen that area
00:52:47.359 gail mcveigh teaches language arts as
00:52:49.599 well as social studies
00:52:51.280 she's constantly looking for new ways to
00:52:53.280 get her students to read
00:52:55.520 i may read
00:52:56.720 half a novel and then tell the students
00:52:58.880 they'll have to find out
00:53:00.480 by themselves by reading the rest of it
00:53:02.559 what happens at the end
00:53:04.559 gail mcveigh also encourages her
00:53:06.480 students to write as much as possible so
00:53:08.880 when her students visit the computer lab
00:53:11.119 they're expected to go beyond simple
00:53:12.960 keyboard exercises after you have done
00:53:15.119 so
00:53:16.000 you may begin to type the introduction
00:53:18.319 of your composition telling winnie what
00:53:20.720 it is that you feel she should do about
00:53:22.720 the problem she faces regarding whether
00:53:25.280 or not to drink water from the magical
00:53:27.119 spring the students love to write about
00:53:30.480 what i have read or what they have read
00:53:33.520 and i allow them a lot of leeway and
00:53:37.280 and what they will write about
00:53:39.119 you know to them it's an opportunity to
00:53:40.880 express themselves and to relate in some
00:53:43.599 way to literature
00:53:46.000 the emphasis on reading is evident
00:53:47.920 throughout charles rice
00:53:49.920 every school day starts with 10 minutes
00:53:52.000 during which students and teachers drop
00:53:54.000 everything and read to the accompaniment
00:53:57.440 of classical music
00:54:01.040 the basic idea is that children
00:54:04.559 should see
00:54:05.760 and have some time for what we call
00:54:07.760 sustained silent reading but the
00:54:10.400 children get to select any material they
00:54:12.559 want for that period
00:54:14.319 they also get to see their teacher
00:54:16.800 and their principal and others
00:54:19.200 stopping at a point in time
00:54:22.000 to read and the idea is that everybody
00:54:24.640 in our building
00:54:26.000 will read for 10 minutes at that time so
00:54:29.119 charles rice keeps rolling along
00:54:31.760 for that matter so does louise smith
00:54:33.680 this table over here she now travels
00:54:36.000 among her 13 schools offering guidance
00:54:38.720 and wisdom
00:54:41.040 and even though she hasn't taught class
00:54:42.640 in more than 20 years louise smith can't
00:54:45.280 resist taking over a classroom once in a
00:54:47.440 while
00:54:49.760 i'm going to read to you today the story
00:54:52.319 the patchwork
00:54:54.319 quilt
00:54:55.440 whenever you're an educator you're first
00:54:57.520 and foremost a teacher what's happening
00:54:59.440 what happened when mama came in
00:55:01.680 as principal of a school i'm a teacher
00:55:04.000 of teachers
00:55:05.680 as an area director i'm a teacher of
00:55:08.000 principals
00:55:09.520 so i'm constantly teaching
00:55:12.079 when can i go outside ask tanya after
00:55:14.720 eight years as principal at rice louise
00:55:17.119 smith is officially an outsider but her
00:55:19.760 presence and her influence remain
00:55:23.040 even though she's not principal here
00:55:24.799 they would still say you know louise
00:55:26.400 smith would not have that and you would
00:55:28.319 not do that you wouldn't do it if louise
00:55:30.160 smith was here so you're going to act
00:55:31.520 the way
00:55:32.640 are you supposed to act you're going to
00:55:33.920 act the way if louise smith was still
00:55:35.520 principal here so she still has a big
00:55:38.240 impact here she's i don't think she's
00:55:40.400 she hasn't left yet it will be a couple
00:55:42.799 years down the line but right now she's
00:55:44.799 still here
00:55:46.240 but with every passing day this school
00:55:48.319 belongs less to louise smith
00:55:51.040 more to geraldine hughes are you having
00:55:52.960 a good day
00:55:54.319 great great
00:55:56.559 things seem to be in place for charles
00:55:58.400 rice to maintain its record of success
00:56:01.200 very good
00:56:02.400 this became flat as it sat right here
00:56:05.280 i just didn't think of society there are
00:56:07.280 still outstanding teachers
00:56:09.520 a committed administration
00:56:12.240 caring parents
00:56:13.680 and everyone is striving together for
00:56:15.920 the same thing
00:56:17.680 it's excellent
00:56:19.200 that's all they want
00:56:21.200 excellence and i think that's just
00:56:23.040 something that has been embedded in
00:56:25.119 everybody teachers uh and i think that
00:56:28.079 dr dudes is you know just in a wonderful
00:56:30.880 position now to come in and keep that
00:56:33.200 going
00:56:34.240 uh this is her first year you know
00:56:36.480 parents are gonna watch because parents
00:56:39.280 at charles rice expect that certain
00:56:41.040 things happen
00:56:42.240 louis
00:56:43.119 smith did pass on the baton to me
00:56:46.079 and uh she kind of moved to the side and
00:56:48.880 said
00:56:50.160 you know now dr dudes you do it
00:56:52.400 and i feel like it is a race it's one
00:56:55.359 that you have to ever be diligent
00:56:58.559 and you have to look behind you and in
00:57:00.079 front of you you have to keep moving
00:57:02.240 um and you have to move fast because
00:57:04.400 there's so much to learn and so little
00:57:06.480 time to do it
00:57:08.930 
00:57:50.559 you
