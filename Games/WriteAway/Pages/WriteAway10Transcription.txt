00:10:01.640 sometimes it's hard to know how to even
00:10:03.899 start a story well one way is to write
00:10:06.420 about something or someone you know very
00:10:08.519 well like let's say for example your dog
00:10:11.040 Fido
00:10:12.980 or you're weird and Bertha well our next
00:10:17.459 author gives us a peek at someone he
00:10:19.080 knows very well Garrett finale a fifth
00:10:21.959 grader from Ojo Amarillo School in
00:10:23.820 Fruitland New Mexico introduces us to
00:10:26.339 his favorite person in my mom
00:10:30.980 I was born in Shiprock and when I was a
00:10:34.440 baby I saw my mom
00:10:37.320 I heard her laugh
00:10:42.980 
00:10:44.700 then we went home
00:10:49.019 soon I felt like a free baby
00:10:53.279 and I grew a little older I wished I
00:10:55.440 could have a dog
00:11:03.830 
00:11:12.440 I think it was the best time of my life
00:11:16.100 and that's my mom
00:11:18.080 
00:11:30.790 
00:11:34.700 writing is fun because you can create
00:11:36.720 anything you want in just this past year
00:11:39.240 our young authors have created space
00:11:40.860 aliens monsters time machines and
00:11:43.440 terrible villains it's always enjoyable
00:11:45.540 for us to see what your imaginations
00:11:46.920 have conceived I especially enjoy
00:11:49.140 stories that give us a glimpse of a Time
00:11:51.060 long ago Ashley hadspeth a student at
00:11:54.000 Booker T Washington School in Mesa
00:11:56.100 Arizona lets us see what might happen if
00:11:58.079 we were caught up in a Time Warp
00:12:01.860 once there was a boy named Tom who
00:12:04.019 always played baseball with his friends
00:12:05.880 Bob
00:12:07.019 and Joe
00:12:09.959 okay you play Outfield Tom because
00:12:12.360 you're not very good at batting yeah
00:12:15.180 like you're really good at catching okay
00:12:17.880 you guys
00:12:19.640 Joe hit the ball out to left field and
00:12:22.680 Tom yelled
00:12:24.420 I got it I got it
00:12:29.700 suddenly everything went dark
00:12:32.760 when Tom woke up he was no longer on the
00:12:35.279 baseball field he was in a medieval
00:12:37.500 castle I got it I got it I
00:12:41.399 go where am I
00:12:44.120 oh look at all these Jewels oh and all

00:12:52.320 in Kansas anymore I don't know where I
00:12:55.380 am but I better eat
00:13:00.200 Tom ate and eight until suddenly the
00:13:02.880 wind blew a window open and Tom looked
00:13:05.040 outside to see a beautiful garden
00:13:08.000 foreign this looks like my mom's Garden
00:13:11.639 but something's different I'm gonna
00:13:14.459 investigate
00:13:16.010 
00:13:19.820 this isn't my mom's Garden
00:13:22.740 this is the gardener in a castle I must
00:13:25.860 be in a Time Warp
00:13:28.500 Tom walked into the beautiful garden and
00:13:30.660 started to get homesick thinking about
00:13:32.279 his mom
00:13:33.620 I miss my parents and my home my friends
00:13:38.000 how did that get here I don't know how
00:13:40.920 to get back
00:13:43.139 how did I travel back in time what year
00:13:46.380 is it
00:13:47.339 suddenly a night on Horseback appeared
00:13:49.920 and Tom asked him what year is it why
00:13:53.040 it's 15 22 and I bet you're wondering
00:13:56.399 where you are who am I and how did you
00:13:58.980 get here

00:15:24.850 
00:15:34.040 roses are red violets don't stink but if
00:15:38.459 they are dirty hose them down no that
00:15:41.160 doesn't work
00:15:42.360 I know what will help when writing use
00:15:44.639 the resources available to you
00:15:46.760 encyclopedias dictionaries
00:15:49.199 a rhyming dictionary like this
00:15:52.620 got it
00:15:54.120 roses are red violets don't stink but if
00:15:57.959 they are dirty wash them in the sink
00:16:00.180 
00:16:01.320 you see when you use tools like this
00:16:03.300 they're a valuable resource that helps
00:16:05.339 you put what's in your mind down on
00:16:07.320 paper and whether or not our next writer
00:16:10.079 used one of these he has come up with a
00:16:12.779 very amusing poem in the form of a
00:16:14.820 limerick
00:16:16.560 it was written by Rogelio Ortega a fifth
00:16:19.860 grader at Martin Luther King School in
00:16:22.019 San Diego California
00:16:23.940 and he writes about a young man from
00:16:26.519 Chile
00:16:28.160 there was a young man from Chile
00:16:31.920 who had a new girlfriend named Millie
00:16:35.699 they wanted to dance and took time out
00:16:38.880 to France
00:16:41.940 but they were showing off and being
00:16:45.240 silly
00:16:46.690 
00:16:52.980 
00:16:54.500 the young man from Chile
00:16:57.960 
00:17:03.480 foreign
00:17:04.368 
00:17:19.079 
00:17:24.740 often involves a problem that needs to
00:17:27.299 be resolved for example if you take your
00:17:29.940 character and put them up in a tree then
00:17:31.740 you have to get them back down remember
00:17:33.780 a problem for your character doesn't
00:17:36.059 have to seem important to you only to
00:17:38.460 him or her Courtney Morris is from
