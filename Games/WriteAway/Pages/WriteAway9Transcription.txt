00:17:18.839 one way to write an exciting story is to
00:17:21.480 get your main character into some kind
00:17:22.980 of trouble and then figure out a way to
00:17:24.780 get him out our next story has great
00:17:27.299 characters lots of action and a big mess
00:17:30.660 that our hero gets himself into and our
00:17:32.880 author has created a clever way to get
00:17:34.380 him out it was written by Michael
