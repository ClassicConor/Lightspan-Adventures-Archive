00:02:07.439 she could smell and she could taste do
00:02:10.119 you know what those things are those are
00:02:12.080 our senses and we have five of them we
00:02:14.680 have taste we have
00:02:18.200 smell
00:02:19.920 touch hearing and sight and you might
00:02:23.440 want to try what the kids were doing
00:02:24.959 where you cover your eyes and see if you
00:02:26.720 can identify things just by touching
00:02:28.920 them or smell ing them or tasting them
00:02:31.120 and you'd be surprised just how much
00:02:32.599 your five senses tell you about the
00:02:38.519 world what part of you hears the ocean
00:02:42.840 Roar and the sound of rain as it starts
00:02:47.040 to pour what part of you here's your

00:04:16.160 long
00:04:22.240 sing I'll get
00:04:24.280 it hello ah just a moment it's for you
00:04:28.440 bird thanks Bob hang on you know what
00:04:31.560 this is right it's a telephone and it
00:04:33.800 can help us think about how our five
00:04:35.479 senses work when I speak into the
00:04:38.000 telephone my voice goes in here right
00:04:41.080 but does it stay right there well of
00:04:43.520 course not it becomes a message that
00:04:46.360 goes down this chord and then it goes
00:04:49.000 into another chord that goes into the
00:04:51.080 wall then through a whole bunch of other
00:04:52.840 chords all the way across town until it
00:04:54.880 gets to the person on the other end and
00:04:56.759 they get the message well the same kind
00:04:59.160 of thing happens in your ear the sound
00:05:02.240 goes into your ear and your ear sends a
00:05:04.680 message along a kind of chord the chord
00:05:07.160 in your body is called a nerve where do
00:05:09.960 you think these nerves go to your brain
00:05:13.520 that's the place inside of your head
00:05:15.080 that controls your body your brain gets
00:05:17.680 the message that you're hearing
00:05:18.919 something it works the same way with all
00:05:21.240 of your senses hearing taste smell sight
00:05:24.639 and touch when you taste some food with
00:05:27.400 your mouth The Taste doesn't stop there
00:05:29.600 there your mouth sends a message along
00:05:32.080 nerves straight to your
00:05:34.919 brain when you smell something with your
00:05:37.120 nose or see something with your eyes or
00:05:40.039 touch something with your hand or feel
00:05:41.919 something with your foot all of those
00:05:44.160 messages are sent to your brain through
00:05:48.240 nerves and the nerves end up here in
00:05:51.600 your brain that's in my head yeah it's
00:05:54.639 hard to believe isn't it your brain is
00:05:56.240 kind of folded on itself and wrinkled
00:05:58.720 and it's actually spongy and kind of
00:06:00.560 soft but it sits in your head just like
00:06:02.800 this cool yeah this brain's a little
00:06:05.520 bigger than a real one just so that we
00:06:06.960 can see it actually Larry over here can
00:06:09.080 show us what the brain really looks like
00:06:11.240 in the head let's suppose that Larry has
00:06:13.840 a splitting headache today okay we can
00:06:15.880 cut his head right down the middle and
00:06:18.560 inside there's the brain can you see how
00:06:20.919 it completely fills the top part of the
00:06:22.639 head there and part of the brain goes
00:06:25.720 down the back and these are nerves that
00:06:28.280 connect in your neck so those go down
00:06:30.599 like this they go down your neck and
00:06:32.720 then they go through some other nerves
00:06:34.400 that are down your back it's ticklish
00:06:36.840 cuz there're a lot of nerves there and
00:06:38.400 the messages from your senses come in
00:06:40.400 here at the bottom of your back now what
00:06:42.440 do you think that your brain does with
00:06:44.440 all those messages it gets from your
00:06:45.680 senses I don't know well let's suppose
00:06:48.440 that we're going to go for a walk in the
00:06:49.759 woods okay so let's start walking
00:06:51.319 through the woods nice day having a good
00:06:53.319 time all of a sudden your ears hear some
00:06:56.039 rustling in the leaves and your eyes see
00:06:58.680 a little black animal with a white
00:07:00.400 stripe down its back and your nose
00:07:02.520 smells something really awful I'm in
00:07:05.199 trouble well your brain takes these
00:07:07.400 senses in and thinks about them really
00:07:09.520 fast and what's it the side I found a
00:07:12.479 skunk a skunk so quickly your brain
00:07:15.520 takes those signals and sends new
00:07:17.280 messages on other nerves back down to
00:07:19.240 your body to tell it what to do and your
00:07:21.120 brain tells your legs to start running
00:07:22.759 start running legs and your brain tells
00:07:24.520 your arms to start pping PP hard and
00:07:26.919 your brain tells your lungs to start
00:07:28.360 breathing hard yeah so you can get lots
00:07:30.160 of oxygen and
00:07:33.840 I'm well the important thing is that
00:07:36.479 your brain takes messages from your
00:07:38.879 senses thinks about them and then sends
00:07:41.560 other messages back to your body to tell
00:07:43.280 it what you do your brain is kind of
00:07:45.360 like a Control Center and it controls
00:07:47.560 everything that you
00:07:50.199 do now I wonder when you're walking
00:07:53.720 through a forest and you see a skunk how
00:07:56.159 do you know that it's a skunk I mean
00:07:58.240 that that may seem like a silly question
00:07:59.800 but why don't you say hey there's an
00:08:01.960 elephant or hey there's my bicycle well
00:08:05.000 that's because you know what a skunk
00:08:06.599 looks like your brain remembers it maybe
00:08:10.080 maybe you've seen a picture of a skunk
00:08:11.879 or a drawing like this maybe you've seen
00:08:13.800 a live one at the zoo or on the side of
00:08:15.479 the road so your brain remembers what a
00:08:17.759 skunk looks like so you'll know it when
00:08:19.240 you see it now your brain doesn't
00:08:20.720 remember everything I mean I'm always
00:08:22.599 forgetting where I left my pencil do you
00:08:24.960 forget things sometimes well that's okay
00:08:27.199 everybody does it but what your brain
00:08:29.759 remembers is amazing I mean you remember
00:08:32.559 the letters of the alphabet you remember
00:08:34.880 that this is a baseball you remember
00:08:37.240 that this is a hat you know the names of
00:08:39.599 your family and your friends and that
00:08:41.679 list just goes on and on and on and
00:08:43.240 that's because remembering is the most
00:08:45.320 important thing that your brain does you
00:08:47.320 know that everybody's brain is special
00:08:50.080 and your brain might be special at some
00:08:51.760 things like arithmetic or spelling and
00:08:54.000 other people are special in other things
00:08:56.240 for example I know that arnell's brain
00:08:58.640 is really good at something what drawing
00:09:02.360 oh yeah I try to remember things and
00:09:04.720 then I try to paint them that's right
00:09:07.560 Louisa what do you think your brain's
00:09:09.079 really good at well I like to read and I
00:09:11.640 like to play games but I also know that
00:09:13.680 you like
00:09:15.519 gymnastics but does my brain do that
00:09:18.079 absolutely your brain is really good at
00:09:20.000 controlling everything that your body
00:09:21.519 does well Naomi has a friend who's
00:09:24.040 really talented and she showed us how
00:09:26.320 her brain helps her do amazing things
00:09:29.800 hi this is Naomi and I'm here with Karen
00:09:32.160 in Karen's room and Merlin her
00:09:34.640 dog hi Karen hi Karen what is cerebral
00:09:39.120 policy well cerebral policy means that
00:09:42.040 the brain was damaged at Birth usually
00:09:44.160 because not enough oxygen and so the
00:09:46.800 brain doesn't give the right messages to
00:09:48.560 the muscles and it affects some things
00:09:51.399 it's hard for me to use my arms or legs
00:09:53.399 but it doesn't affect my thinking I
00:09:55.320 can't believe you're only 16 in your
00:09:57.320 writing books what kind of books do you
00:10:00.320 write well I've written a children's
00:10:02.279 book about Merlin and how he helps me
00:10:04.480 and I've also written a mystery novel
00:10:07.240 where do you get your ideas well just
00:10:09.560 anywhere a lot of times people I know
00:10:11.360 will become characters in my books and
00:10:13.680 ideas that I think of or that of things
00:10:15.839 that I see and hear what other things do
00:10:18.200 you write um well I write for the school
00:10:21.160 newspaper which is called the whole
00:10:22.800 press and I also have written some
00:10:25.240 essays and short stories do you have any
00:10:27.640 problems getting around at School
00:10:30.519 sometimes they've done a lot to help
00:10:32.480 people with disabilities at school by
00:10:34.240 making things more accessible but a lot
00:10:36.279 of times it's hard because people who
00:10:38.519 aren't in wheelchairs don't know what to
00:10:40.480 do around people who are how does Merlin
00:10:42.920 help you at school well he uh carries my
00:10:46.279 books for me how does he help you around
00:10:48.760 the
00:10:49.639 house well he's um trying to retrieve
00:10:52.839 things that I drop because I can't reach
00:10:54.639 the floor when I'm in my wheelchair and
00:10:56.959 um he can go and get my mom if I need
00:10:58.800 her he opens the door for me turns
00:11:01.200 lights on and off um all kinds of
00:11:04.639 things how was Merlin train to do these
00:11:07.560 things well he was trained by Canan
00:11:10.279 companions for Independence in Ohio and
00:11:12.800 they especially trained dogs to assist
00:11:15.000 people who have disabilities Merin knows
00:11:17.120 about 70 commands how do you write with
00:11:20.040 your computer my computer has a special
00:11:22.680 program that can recognize my voice if I
00:11:25.440 say a word the computer actually can can
00:11:27.959 hear it and understand and then it
00:11:29.760 prints it on the screen and this helps
00:11:31.920 because it's hard for me to type things
00:11:33.600 that are long because my hands get tired
00:11:35.920 why do you think you're such a good
00:11:37.399 student you've won all kinds of awards
00:11:39.639 and everything I don't know I I I work
00:11:42.680 hard and and I want to accomplish things
00:11:45.120 so I just work
00:11:49.399 hard so your brain is a pretty wonderful
00:11:52.160 thing it lets you think it lets you
00:11:54.079 learn it lets you use your senses now
00:11:56.560 what do you think would happen if your
00:11:58.079 brain was hurt somehow well you may not
00:12:00.920 be able to learn or think or use your
00:12:03.040 senses as well as you can use them right
00:12:04.639 now you know this model of the brain
00:12:07.160 that we've been using here is actually
00:12:09.000 made of plastic and it's it's kind of
00:12:11.279 hard if you were to hold a real brain in
00:12:13.199 your hand it would actually feel quite
00:12:14.440 different it would feel sort of soft and
00:12:16.480 Squishy a real brain is about as soft as
00:12:21.040 pudding plop and that soft brain needs
00:12:24.600 to be protected so where does your body
00:12:26.279 protect it well Mr Bones can show us
00:12:28.120 that hi Mr Bones nice hat your brain is
00:12:32.120 protected by a very hard bone at the top
00:12:34.279 of your head called your skull and you
00:12:36.760 can feel your skull if you just tap your
00:12:38.199 head lightly on the side you feel how
00:12:40.160 hard it is there and it's hard all the
00:12:42.480 way around your head a hard skull
00:12:46.560 protecting a soft brain and it's
00:12:48.800 important to protect our brains because
00:12:51.120 if you hurt your brain it's very
00:12:53.000 difficult to make it healthy again and
00:12:54.720 we need healthy brains because there are
00:12:58.160 five senses
00:12:59.760 hearing taste smell sight and touch your
00:13:03.800 sense organs send messages Along Chords
00:13:06.399 called nerves the nerves carry the
00:13:09.000 messages to your
00:13:10.360 brain your brain can think it also sends
00:13:14.000 messages back to your body it's your
00:13:16.320 control
00:13:17.240 center your brain remembers things
00:13:20.440 because you can remember you can
00:13:22.800 learn every brain is special and needs
00:13:26.120 to be
00:13:27.199 protected Che on come on Cher
00:13:30.120 let's the time is running out is he
00:13:32.480 going to do it is he going to make it
00:13:33.639 he's in the home stretch now here he
00:13:34.959 comes oh it's getting close and
00:13:38.519 Y okay well that was pretty good
00:13:40.720 Christopher but
00:13:42.639 now do you think you can do it again
00:13:45.120 faster than that I'm sure I can
00:13:49.839 okay look at him go this time look at
00:13:52.079 how fast he is do yeah whoa look at that
00:13:56.560 new world record yay
00:13:59.959 now that's using your brain okay Lu do
00:14:02.800 you want to try one too here let's see
00:14:04.360 if you can do another one see if you can
00:14:05.720 get the get across the river okay this
00:14:07.720 is
00:14:27.680 another




00:14:56.360 when you get up in the morning and look
00:14:58.480 in in the mirror you see your eyes mouth
00:15:00.639 teeth hair ears and nose your muscles

00:15:06.079 you to wear your clothes You' got your
00:15:09.079 lungs and stomach and brain and heart
00:15:11.680 and what we think and feels a very
00:15:13.639 important part of how we're put together
00:15:16.480 why we do what we do I look like me and
00:15:19.519 you look like you it's a bunch ofat
00:15:22.199 stuff it's fun to know watch listen and
00:15:25.279 learn with head to

00:16:26.800 movie but you know invisible Invaders
00:16:29.639 really do exist we call them germs and
00:16:32.560 germs are so small that you can only see
00:16:35.120 them through a microscope germs float
00:16:37.680 through the air they land on your
00:16:39.959 furniture they cling to your drinking
00:16:42.759 glass they even land on your skin germs
00:16:45.720 are everywhere and it's important that
00:16:47.680 we think about germs because if they get
00:16:49.920 inside your body you can become really
00:16:52.040 sick and we all know that getting sick
00:16:53.759 isn't much fun so let's have a look
00:16:56.360 through the
00:16:57.279 microscope and and see what these tiny
00:16:59.360 germs really look
00:17:01.360 like germs are alive if germs like these
00:17:05.280 get into your body you might get the flu
00:17:08.119 germs may give you a runny nose sore
00:17:10.359 throat make you sneeze and cough so you
00:17:12.599 have to stay home from
00:17:14.240 school these germs can get into your
00:17:16.679 body and make you sick but how do they
00:17:18.880 get in there I mean your skin covers
00:17:20.880 most of your body and it protects you
00:17:22.359 against germs but your skin doesn't
00:17:25.199 cover everything it has holes in it in
00:17:27.480 fact I hate to tell you but you've got
00:17:29.640 holes in your head mob that's not a very
00:17:31.960 nice thing to say well it's true shaa
00:17:34.160 you do have holes in your head what do
00:17:36.240 you listen with my ears aha two big
00:17:39.080 holes right in the side of your head
00:17:41.360 what do you speak with my mouth ah
00:17:43.520 another big hole right in the front of
00:17:44.799 your face and my nose is another hole
00:17:47.120 right so we've got three holes right
00:17:49.360 there three ways that germs can get in
00:17:51.760 but what do you do I mean you can't you
00:17:53.559 can't cover your ears and close your
00:17:55.159 mouth and plug your nose forever so how
00:17:57.640 do we protect ourselves against those
00:17:59.960 germs
00:18:02.480 H and now it's time for the attack of
00:18:05.640 the invisible Invaders part two Sparky
00:18:09.799 the invisible Invaders are all around us
00:18:12.720 they're on my microphone they're on my
00:18:14.960 Juice Glass they're floating in the air
00:18:18.120 we have to stop them before they enter
00:18:20.320 our bodies but
00:18:22.600 how Sparky what are you doing no jge can
00:18:27.280 attack me in here
00:18:29.320 there has to be an easier
00:18:32.480 way well Sam's right germs are
00:18:35.400 everywhere but you don't have to wear a
00:18:36.880 rubber suit and a mask to keep them out
00:18:38.720 of your body there are other things you
00:18:40.320 can do things that are really easy what
00:18:42.799 do you think is the best way to protect
00:18:44.720 yourself from germs should you clean
00:18:47.120 your room wash your hands or comb your
00:18:50.559 hair what do you think is the best way
00:18:52.840 to keep germs out of your body you
00:18:56.679 decide well what did you decide shaa do
00:19:00.200 you know the answer wash your hands
00:19:02.919 right when you wash your hands you can
00:19:05.600 see that dirt gets cleaned away but what
00:19:07.919 you don't see is that most of the germs
00:19:09.760 on your hands get killed that's because
00:19:11.919 soap and water kill germs and your hands
00:19:14.559 can have a lot of germs on them why
00:19:17.440 because we use our hands for
00:19:19.919 everything hello ladies and germs and
00:19:23.080 speaking of those cuckoo nutty little
00:19:25.039 wacko germs nobody wants them so here's
00:19:28.559 a little tune about what you can do to
00:19:31.000 get rid of
00:19:34.360 him what you going to do
00:19:38.760 today what things will you make what
00:19:42.159 games will you play whatever you choose
00:19:46.039 you're probably going to use your
00:19:48.640 [Music]
00:19:50.159 hands oh you're going to tie your
00:19:54.600 shoes will you comb your hair will you
00:19:57.960 re read the news even just reading buddy
00:20:02.679 you'll be needing those
00:20:07.120 hands you might clean up your bedroom or
00:20:12.240 go dig around for
00:20:15.240 worms but did you know that much of the
00:20:19.200 world is positively crawling with GS
00:20:23.679 what you going to do
00:20:26.679 tonight will you help make dinner where
00:20:29.880 you sitting right no matter what is
00:20:34.200 done understand if you want to squash
00:20:37.760 those germs by gosh whenever you can
00:20:41.960 just hear me man you're going to have to
00:20:45.480 wash wash those
00:20:48.240 hands scrubby
00:20:57.120 dubdub
00:20:59.480 every time you touch something there's a
00:21:01.520 chance that germs get onto your hands so
00:21:04.360 then when you touch your face like
00:21:05.720 around your eyes or your nose or your
00:21:07.120 mouth those germs could get into your
00:21:09.200 body but if you wash your hands with
00:21:12.039 soap and water that kills a lot of the
00:21:14.600 germs on your hands so there aren't as
00:21:16.520 many of them to get into your body and
00:21:18.279 there are some other things you can do
00:21:19.400 as well suppose you're outside playing
00:21:22.559 and you fall down and you cut yourself
00:21:24.799 you know I mean it happens all the time
00:21:25.960 you scrape your knee well that cut
00:21:28.120 becomes another hole in your body so if
00:21:30.559 you wash the cut with soap and water
00:21:32.640 then that can prevent germs from getting
00:21:34.320 in here's something else suppose you're
00:21:37.159 thirsty you'd like a drink go over to
00:21:39.080 the sink and you see a glass sitting
00:21:41.400 there but other people have been
00:21:43.679 drinking from this glass before you
00:21:45.760 should you take a drink from it yes or
00:21:48.440 no well the answer is no the people who
00:21:52.080 drank from this class before you left
00:21:53.679 germs around the rim so when you drink
00:21:56.159 from it those germs can go into your
00:21:57.760 mouth and into your body so wash the
00:22:00.200 glass before you drink from it one more
00:22:03.159 thing suppose a friend of yours got a
00:22:05.679 really nice big lollipop and has been
00:22:08.760 licking it away and they offer you a
00:22:10.919 lick should you lick the lollipop yes or
00:22:14.159 no uh-uh even though you can't see them
00:22:18.039 the germs are there and they could make
00:22:20.039 you sick but you know something oh hi Mr
00:22:23.360 Bones nice mask your body is very very
00:22:27.600 good at fighting
00:22:29.440 germs inside of your body are millions
00:22:32.120 of special cells a tiny Army of germ
00:22:35.039 killers that live in your blood when
00:22:37.440 germs get into your body these special
00:22:39.520 cells find the germs and attack
00:22:42.640 them these germ killers are always at
00:22:45.200 work trying to keep you healthy but
00:22:47.600 sometimes they can't kill the germs fast
00:22:49.480 enough and well that's when you get sick
00:22:52.039 so what happens then well that's when
00:22:53.840 your doctor or your parents give you
00:22:56.520 medicine some medicines are germ Killers
00:22:59.120 too they find the germs attack them and
00:23:02.320 soon you feel
00:23:04.080 better Shauna has some pictures of
00:23:06.559 different kinds of medicines so shaa
00:23:08.480 who's the guy in the picture that's my
00:23:10.000 friend Joey ah so where are his
00:23:11.880 medicines well sometimes when you're
00:23:14.000 sick you have to take pills and
00:23:16.080 sometimes the medicine is in a bottle
00:23:17.760 when it's a liquid uh-huh you take it
00:23:19.600 with a spoon this really isn't medicine
00:23:22.200 but when you're sick getting rest is
00:23:24.000 good because that helps kill germs too
00:23:26.520 and sometimes you have to go the doctor
00:23:28.559 and he gives you a shot do you like
00:23:30.279 getting shots no I hate them why because
00:23:32.840 they hurt oh well sometimes they sting
00:23:35.480 just a little bit but that's only for a
00:23:37.400 moment then the germs are killed faster
00:23:39.600 and you feel better that much quicker so
00:23:41.480 what's your last
00:23:43.039 picture that's Joey Joey where well he
00:23:46.919 got a shot so he felt better and he went
00:23:49.279 out to play I should have known you know
00:23:52.279 before we had medicine kids got sick a
00:23:54.640 lot more than they do today without the
00:23:56.640 medicine they got things like measles
00:23:58.320 and MPS and whooping cough and almost
00:24:00.480 anybody could get those diseases but
00:24:02.440 today we have super special germ killers
00:24:04.960 and they keep you from getting those
00:24:06.320 diseases well our friend Sarah went to
00:24:08.480 the health clinic and she got some of
00:24:10.279 those super special germ
00:24:19.600 Killers but Dad I'm not sick I know
00:24:23.840 you're not sick so why do I have to go
00:24:26.200 to the doctor's soah
00:24:28.360 sometimes we have to go to the doctors
00:24:29.840 even when we're not sick why I'll let
00:24:32.799 the doctor tell you
00:24:38.320 okay say ah ah I'm not sick oh I know
00:24:43.039 you're not sick in fact you look very
00:24:44.880 healthy so why do I have to go to the
00:24:47.559 doctor's well we don't want you to
00:24:49.399 become sick a long time ago kids used to
00:24:52.919 get spots all over their face and cough
00:24:55.279 or their neck and face would get very
00:24:57.240 swollen
00:24:58.320 or sometimes they couldn't even walk
00:25:00.600 could that happen to
00:25:02.320 me well it could but today we're going
00:25:05.880 to give you a vaccine so that you don't
00:25:08.159 get sick the vaccine is in the form of a
00:25:11.720 shot do you want a shot or do you want
00:25:15.000 to take a chance on getting
00:25:16.740 [Music]
00:25:24.799 sick I think I went to have the sh
00:25:28.640 I think you made a very good
00:25:34.880 choice I know I
00:25:39.120 did invisible Invaders called germs are
00:25:42.000 all around
00:25:47.720 you they can get into your
00:25:53.200 body you get a lot of germs on your
00:25:55.640 hands but soap and water kills
00:25:58.640 germs so the best way to fight germs is
00:26:01.240 to wash your hands often especially
00:26:03.720 before you eat and after you go to the
00:26:08.840 bathroom and never put objects into your
00:26:11.320 mouth or anything that other people have
00:26:13.360 put into
00:26:16.440 theirs if germs get into your body
00:26:19.159 they're attacked by germ killers in your
00:26:22.679 blood medicines also help kill germs in
00:26:25.559 your
00:26:26.600 body special medicines called vaccines
00:26:29.880 can keep you from getting the measles
00:26:31.600 and other terrible
00:26:34.840 diseases ooh this is terrible this is
00:26:38.320 horrible this is the worst thing in the
00:26:40.440 history of the universe what Sparky what

00:26:58.120 do to the cut on his finger to protect
00:27:00.279 him from the attack of the invisible
00:27:03.760 Invaders do you

00:28:46.720 sounds and he wants us to try to guess
00:28:48.799 what they are okay
00:28:54.240 listen that's easy that's the sound of a
00:28:57.159 clock

00:29:30.159 so many different kinds of sounds and
00:29:32.159 they tell us so much about the world
00:29:33.960 have you ever taken the time to just
00:29:35.440 stop and
00:29:43.600 listen well that was a siren was it a
00:29:46.279 police car an ambulance ah

00:29:56.120 piano no really does oh you just play
00:29:58.919 the tape recorder right very funny
00:30:01.519 sounds tell us so much about the world
00:30:03.720 like the siren tells us to get out of
00:30:05.480 the way and music well it just makes us
00:30:07.840 feel good but if you ever wondered how
00:30:10.279 do sounds happen and how are we able to
00:30:12.960 hear all of the sounds that are around
00:30:15.480 us sound begins when something vibrates
00:30:19.039 that means it shakes or Quivers very
00:30:21.000 fast like this violin
00:30:23.159 string that vibration makes the air
00:30:25.679 around it vibrate too
00:30:28.279 the vibrating bits of air we've colored
00:30:30.279 them yellow so you can see them spread
00:30:32.240 out in all directions when the air
00:30:34.440 vibrations reach your ear they make
00:30:36.600 parts of your ear vibrate and that's
00:30:38.679 when you
00:30:39.960 [Music]
00:30:42.640 hear that was the sound of somebody
00:30:45.159 playing a violin yep how many sounds did
00:30:48.159 you
00:30:49.600 get wow that was a great sound
00:30:52.720 Christopher that was really realistic
00:30:54.559 but I didn't do that you didn't
00:30:57.530 [Music]
00:31:03.279 uhoh is is everybody okay what happened
00:31:07.000 we accidentally tied over recycling bins
00:31:10.320 we were looking for these tin cans we're
00:31:13.240 going to make a telephone oh a tin can
00:31:16.600 telephone oh that's a great project
00:31:18.679 we'll clean up first okay can
00:31:20.880 Christopher help you work on it yeah
00:31:22.760 okay you guys get busy there have you
00:31:24.760 ever done that Tred to make a telephone
00:31:26.440 out of two1 hands in a string it's a
00:31:28.440 great thing to do because it really
00:31:29.679 shows you how sound comes from
00:31:31.360 vibrations now while the kids are
00:31:33.039 working on their telephone that gives us
00:31:34.960 a chance to think about what happens to
00:31:37.279 those vibrations when they get inside
00:31:38.960 your ears and oh hi Mr Bones nice your
00:31:43.320 muffs when somebody says ears what do
00:31:46.120 you think of these things right well
00:31:49.480 here's a model of your ears and it shows
00:31:51.279 you what your ear looks like on the
00:31:52.559 outside and on the inside now let's talk
00:31:55.320 about the outside part first now now the
00:31:57.399 part of your ear that you can see on the
00:31:59.240 outside of your head is called the outer
00:32:01.399 ear because it's on the outside and this
00:32:03.679 part acts kind of like well like
00:32:06.200 this this is a cone the kids made it
00:32:08.880 it's just out of paper and when sound
00:32:11.279 goes in here it comes out the other end
00:32:13.360 and if I hold this up to my ears I can
00:32:15.880 hear much better now I can hear the
00:32:18.519 sound of the refrigerator
00:32:21.120 motor and I can hear the sound of the
00:32:23.080 bird outside hello bird hi Bob would you
00:32:26.519 like to try it
00:32:27.720 let's do
00:32:29.679 this the kids are still working on their
00:32:31.960 telephone way on the other side of the
00:32:33.559 room can you hear them listen
00:32:36.880 hello you can hear them a little bit but
00:32:38.960 they're kind of far away now let's try
00:32:40.760 it with this we'll bring down our
00:32:42.240 microphone here so you can hear better
00:32:44.880 now listen to what happens when I put
00:32:47.240 the cone over
00:32:49.519 top do it sound like
00:32:51.639 now b
00:32:54.039 t What b e
00:32:58.440 can you hear them better now it must be
00:33:00.440 fun now listen to what happens when I
00:33:02.240 turn it over this way can you hear them
00:33:06.639 now not as well you hear best when your
00:33:09.440 ears are pointed right at the
00:33:12.480 sound I'm going to the museum today are
00:33:16.120 you going so that's how the outer part
00:33:18.279 of your ear works it sort of works like
00:33:20.000 this cone to direct sound into your head
00:33:23.480 in fact you can do this yourself try
00:33:25.120 this right now just take your hands Dr
00:33:27.200 them like that and put them behind your
00:33:28.919 ears and listen can you hear better in
00:33:32.399 fact I can hear my own voice better now
00:33:34.279 because my hands are directing the sound
00:33:37.240 into my ear so that's why the outside of
00:33:40.120 your ear is sort of shaped like a CED
00:33:42.720 hand and it directs the sound where into
00:33:46.120 a hole and that hole goes here now
00:33:50.279 sounds are vibrations in the air and
00:33:52.679 when they go into your ear the first
00:33:54.360 thing they hit is a drum it looks like
00:33:56.799 this this let me take this piece out
00:33:58.799 it's called your eard drum because it
00:34:00.360 really looks like a little drum it's
00:34:02.200 round and it has a very tight skin
00:34:04.360 across the center and when Sound
00:34:06.159 Vibrations hit that it vibrates up and
00:34:08.560 down many times a second really fast and
00:34:10.679 I can show you how that works in fact
00:34:12.639 this is something that you can try
00:34:14.520 yourself I've taken a glass and attached
00:34:18.800 some plastic wrap to it and stretched it
00:34:21.839 very tightly over the opening of the
00:34:23.639 glass so that it's really tight like a
00:34:25.879 drum like your eardrum now when Sound
00:34:29.079 Vibrations hit that it will vibrate up
00:34:30.879 and down and just to show you what that
00:34:32.719 looks like let's put some salt on top of
00:34:36.199 our drum and that's just so that we can
00:34:38.079 see how it vibrates when sound hits it
00:34:40.560 now we need some sound let's see here's
00:34:42.599 a ukulele we can use this watch what
00:34:46.399 happens to the Salt when I make a
00:34:53.320 sound can you see how the salt vibrates
00:34:55.918 it dances around that's because the
00:34:57.800 surface of the drum is bouncing up and
00:34:59.920 down vibrating when the sound vibrations
00:35:01.920 hit
00:35:03.200 it sort of dancing to the music in fact
00:35:05.920 it'll also work with my voice la la
00:35:10.800 la so that's what happens when sound
00:35:13.320 goes into your ear the sound vibrations
00:35:16.079 cause your eard drum to vibrate back and
00:35:18.800 forth many times a second like the salt
00:35:21.000 was on the glass now attached to your
00:35:22.720 eardrum are three very tiny little bones
00:35:25.240 they're actually the smallest bones in
00:35:26.520 your body body and this is called the
00:35:28.680 middle ear because it's kind of in the
00:35:30.160 middle of your ear and when your ear
00:35:32.000 drum vibrates like this those bones
00:35:34.400 vibrate back and forth the bones are
00:35:37.280 attached to another piece called your
00:35:38.920 inner ear because it's farther in and
00:35:40.880 it's a round part right here that has
00:35:42.520 liquid inside it now what do you think
00:35:44.560 happens when these bones vibrate what
00:35:47.440 happens to the liquid well the liquid's
00:35:49.640 going to vibrate too right so in fact
00:35:51.960 your whole ear actually vibrates and
00:35:54.440 moves back and forth every time you hear
00:35:57.000 a sound now when that liquid moves
00:35:58.800 inside it touches a special nerve and
00:36:01.680 that nerve sends a signal off to your
00:36:03.800 brain and your brain says I hear a
00:36:07.640 sound and I hear a sound I'll get
00:36:12.200 it oh hi Bird come on in hi it's good to
00:36:15.359 see oh I I guess I should say hi
00:36:20.280 bird um is this for

00:36:52.960 me watch this is bird this is River
00:36:59.839 we are we are going to make a
00:37:06.760 telephone um we'll show you uh when it's
00:37:13.800 finished oh okay bye bir sorry you got
00:37:17.680 to
00:37:18.920 go I have to go to work on the telephone
00:37:22.040 okay you go work on that with the other
00:37:23.560 kids see I wonder what this is fun stuff
00:37:26.200 let open that later H do you hear all of
00:37:29.520 the sounds around you are your ears okay
00:37:32.599 well one of the ways that you can find
00:37:34.280 out is to have your ears tested and
00:37:36.720 that's what Diego did last week and I'm
00:37:39.680 going to put these on we're going to do
00:37:42.040 one ear at a time you're going to hear
00:37:43.839 some different sounds it's going to go
00:37:45.200 kind of beep beep beep when you hear the
00:37:46.960 beep I want you to just raise your hand
00:37:48.520 for me okay this one real high okay if
00:37:52.119 you have any questions you stop
00:37:55.599 me
00:37:58.920 okay ready yeah okay we're going to do
00:38:00.640 the right ear first raise your hand when
00:38:02.079 you hear the sounds for
00:38:03.700 [Music]
00:38:07.119 me good now it's going to get softer
00:38:09.319 listen for this
00:38:14.520 one
00:38:19.400 good good now same thing in the other
00:38:22.700 [Music]
00:38:25.359 ear okay
00:38:28.580 [Music]
00:38:31.890 [Applause]
00:38:33.170 [Music]
00:38:39.800 good job okay now this is a graph going
00:38:43.240 across here on this graph are the
00:38:44.480 pitches from low pitch to high pitch
00:38:46.640 going down as loudness down to this
00:38:48.839 black line is considered within normal
00:38:51.680 the red marks are his right ear blue
00:38:53.359 marks are his left ear so it all looks
00:38:55.599 very much within normal across the board
00:38:57.200 at all the pitches so everything looks
00:38:58.920 very normal looks great you did a good
00:39:00.839 job yeah do you have any
00:39:03.560 questions well Diego's hearing is very
00:39:05.880 good and that's great but he still needs
00:39:08.040 to protect his ears because if you don't
00:39:10.599 protect your ears you can lose your
00:39:12.000 hearing especially when it comes to
00:39:13.760 things like loud sounds so if you listen
00:39:16.240 to music especially the real boomy kind
00:39:18.560 if it's too loud it can damage your ears
00:39:21.400 that's why people who work in loud
00:39:23.240 places they wear things like this these
00:39:26.200 are ear protectors and they block out a
00:39:28.640 lot of those loud sounds so the ears are
00:39:30.560 not damaged did you know that you can
00:39:33.720 damage your own
00:39:35.000 ears every time you clean them you
00:39:37.280 should never ever stick anything like
00:39:39.400 this inside your ear this is a cotton
00:39:41.280 swab now you can clean lots of things
00:39:42.880 with these but not your ears because
00:39:45.200 your ear drum remember that little drum
00:39:48.000 that's just inside your ear well if you
00:39:49.800 put a cotton swab in it could push
00:39:51.720 against that and it could damage your
00:39:53.240 eardrum and damage your hearing so if
00:39:55.200 you're gonna wash your ears
00:39:56.960 do it with a cloth and just wash the
00:39:59.079 outside of your ear and do it very
00:40:01.040 gently it's important to keep your ears
00:40:03.359 healthy because the world is full of
00:40:06.640 sounds sounds begin when something
00:40:09.640 vibrates vibrations travel through the
00:40:12.079 air to our ears the ear has five major
00:40:15.480 parts the outer ear which you can see
00:40:18.960 the ear
00:40:20.079 drum three bones attached to the eardrum
00:40:23.520 which pass vibrations on to the liquid
00:40:26.400 in the inner ear which sends a message
00:40:29.079 through a nerve all the way to your
00:40:31.960 brain some people are hearing
00:40:34.560 impaired many of them use signs to
00:40:37.720 communicate you can have your hearing
00:40:40.800 tested loud sounds might damage your
00:40:43.400 ears and never ever put anything inside
00:40:46.480 of
00:40:48.000 them so what's in the box well I don't
00:40:51.040 know this is the box that Bert brought
00:40:52.560 me so let's see what it is in
00:40:54.800 there oo look at that isn't that nice
00:40:57.800 that's a sea shell you know they say
00:40:59.920 that you can hear the sound of the ocean
00:41:01.720 in a seash shell if you listen like this
00:41:04.800 oh yeah can you hear something
00:41:07.800 Christopher yeah isn't that neat maybe
00:41:10.319 we can all try it later on B we got our
00:41:13.040 Tin Can telephones ready you did okay
00:41:15.880 well then let's try it out and see how
00:41:17.440 it
00:41:18.680 works oh really long string you've got
00:41:21.160 on
00:41:23.119 that okay hello hello k can you hear me
00:41:27.079 does this thing work I hear you can you
00:41:30.680 hear me yes really loud isn't that great
00:41:34.160 the phone really works now why do you
00:41:36.599 think that the tin can telephone really
00:41:38.880 does work well now that you know
00:41:40.599 something about vibrations maybe you can
00:41:43.720 figure it out Bob yes Sarah it's for you
00:41:48.119 for me who's calling me here
00:41:52.119 hello I told you not to call me
00:41:55.240 here
00:41:56.960 did it work did you could you really
00:41:59.359 hear through that yeah it really works
00:42:00.839 through the string doesn't it could you





00:42:25.160 yeah
00:42:37.520 when you get up in the morning and look
00:42:39.800 in the mirror you see your eyes mouth
00:42:41.839 teeth hair ears and nose your muscles
00:42:44.520 and Bones give you a real good place for
00:42:47.280 you to wear your clothes you got your
00:42:50.280 lungs and stomach and brain and heart
00:42:52.880 and what we think and feel is a very
00:42:54.839 important part of how we're put together
00:42:57.640 why we do what we do why I look like me
00:43:00.559 and you look like you it's a bunch of
00:43:02.960 neat stuff it's fun to know watch Len
00:43:06.160 and learn with

00:46:11.200 two one
00:46:13.800 good okay Naomi what we're going to do
00:46:16.160 now if you look out through those lenses
00:46:19.000 and then look out without the lenses
00:46:21.160 which looks
00:46:22.240 better with the lenses okay good so what
00:46:25.559 we're going to do now is go to the frame
00:46:27.520 room and help you pick out some glasses
00:46:28.880 for your new prescription
00:46:31.240 okay okay try these the only hard part
00:46:35.359 was deciding which ones look
00:46:37.690 [Music]
00:46:44.280 best
00:46:45.920 [Music]
00:46:49.240 E I like these and these are the ones I
00:46:53.680 picked well they look great well you
00:46:55.640 know since we're talking about glasses
00:46:57.760 this might be a good time to think about
00:46:59.160 how our eyes work do you guys know how
00:47:01.079 your eyes
00:47:02.640 work well let's go over here and have a
00:47:05.079 look at what the eye looks like on the
00:47:07.400 inside
00:47:08.960 this is a model of the eye it sure is
00:47:12.760 Big yeah it is Sarah it's a lot bigger
00:47:14.760 than your real eye but that's just so
00:47:16.200 that we can see what it looks like in
00:47:17.440 all its different parts looks kind of
00:47:19.280 complicated doesn't it now where should
00:47:21.280 I start uh okay I know one of the things
00:47:24.440 that your eyes can do is move can you
00:47:27.240 move your eyes in your head can you move
00:47:28.920 your eyes in your head back and forth
00:47:30.440 side to side like that now it's a good
00:47:32.119 thing that your eyes can move because
00:47:34.720 well can you imagine what it would be
00:47:36.040 like if your eyes look straight ahead
00:47:37.760 all of the time what do you think it
00:47:39.480 would be like to read a book I'll show
00:47:42.640 you yeah that's right left right left
00:47:45.520 right left right your neck muscles would
00:47:47.800 get pretty sore just reading a book you
00:47:49.359 know you look like a cat when you do
00:47:50.800 that that cats cannot move their eyes
00:47:53.200 very much in their head and if you play
00:47:54.880 with a cat they have to follow if you
00:47:56.559 play with a string you know the cat goes
00:47:58.960 they move their whole head cuz they
00:48:00.200 can't move their eyes like we can in our
00:48:01.760 head you know something else because
00:48:03.920 your eyes can move in your head you can
00:48:05.599 see when you walk down the street if
00:48:07.480 your eyes are just straight ahead
00:48:08.640 everything would be really blurry be
00:48:10.079 something like this you know what this
00:48:12.359 is a camera right it's a video camera
00:48:14.880 now it's kind of like an eye isn't it
00:48:16.440 sort of like an electric eye and this
00:48:18.599 part at the front here the eye of the
00:48:20.640 camera cannot move in the camera like
00:48:22.960 your eyes can move in your head so if
00:48:25.040 you walk with the camera down the street
00:48:27.000 and you're not careful and you're just
00:48:28.440 kind of
00:48:30.040 going oh look at that over there oh look
00:48:32.359 at that down there look at this up here
00:48:34.319 the picture gets really blurry right
00:48:36.079 because it's moving too fast it can't
00:48:38.160 compensate but when you walk down the
00:48:39.920 street you can move your head and your
00:48:42.040 eyes stay pointed straight ahead can you
00:48:43.839 do that see if you can look straight
00:48:45.480 ahead move your head up and down like
00:48:47.359 that or side to side and keep your eyes
00:48:49.280 straight ahead see how your eyes can
00:48:51.680 keep looking that's so that you can see
00:48:53.880 when you walk well what what do you
00:48:55.880 think it is that makes your eyes move
00:48:59.000 like that in your head muscles muscles
00:49:00.559 muscles right anything that's moves in
00:49:02.280 your body moves by muscles and that's
00:49:03.960 what these red things are these long red
00:49:06.000 things on the eye those are the muscles
00:49:07.920 that make it move and those little
00:49:09.280 muscles work really hard because your
00:49:11.119 eyes are moving all the time those
00:49:12.839 muscles move about a 100,000 times a day
00:49:16.319 isn't that amazing yeah never stop
00:49:18.000 moving now there's another part of your
00:49:20.400 eye suppose you were sitting in a room
00:49:23.559 by a window and all of a sudden it's
00:49:25.200 really bright Sunbeam comes flashing
00:49:27.599 through at you what would you do Naomi
00:49:30.280 I'd shut the shade and what would that
00:49:32.040 do keep the light from coming in right
00:49:34.480 well there's a part of your eye that
00:49:36.359 does the same thing as a window shade
00:49:38.359 and it's called the iris and it's right
00:49:39.880 at the front and that's the part of your
00:49:42.200 eye that usually has color to it and in
00:49:45.040 fact H I can see three different colors
00:49:48.200 of Iris right here ch's iris is kind of
00:49:51.559 brown and Sarah's iris is kind of blue
00:49:55.079 Hazel
00:49:56.280 and Naomi's iris is really dark brown
00:49:59.200 now what color are mine brownish
00:50:01.760 brownish redish brownish
00:50:04.359 green here's an iris watch what happens
00:50:07.520 when the light gets brighter did you see
00:50:09.720 it close down and when the room gets
00:50:12.200 darker the iris opens
00:50:14.960 wide now that black spot in the middle
00:50:17.440 of your eye that gets big and small when
00:50:19.240 light shines on it that has a name and
00:50:21.440 it's called the pupil pupil like in
00:50:24.599 school
00:50:26.319 yeah it's got the same name as the
00:50:27.760 pupils in school Sarah but this one's a
00:50:29.880 little different let's look at the pupil
00:50:31.760 that's in the iris of this eye we'll
00:50:33.160 take it apart here first we'll take the
00:50:35.559 muscles off these red things remember
00:50:37.280 the muscles that let your eye move in
00:50:39.040 all those different ways and we'll take
00:50:40.760 the eyeball off the top here and right
00:50:44.920 at the very front of the eye there's the
00:50:47.440 iris that's the part that has the color
00:50:49.599 and right in the middle you see that
00:50:50.760 hole that is the pupil now I wonder what
00:50:54.760 would it be like if light could not go
00:50:57.000 through that hole could not can't see
00:50:59.040 anything yeah that's right if there was
00:51:00.760 no light going through the pupil it
00:51:02.119 would be dark you couldn't see anything
00:51:03.200 at all now after the light goes through
00:51:05.280 that then um CH can I borrow your
00:51:09.200 magnifying glass that you were using
00:51:10.640 earlier sure do you want to look at
00:51:13.079 something with it yes I do Sarah I want
00:51:15.200 to look at something but I also want to
00:51:16.880 look at a part of the magnifying glass
00:51:18.880 itself if you ever seen one of these do
00:51:20.880 you know what the glass part of the
00:51:23.160 magnifying glass is actually called he
00:51:25.160 me know the lens very good it's the lens
00:51:27.920 just like the lenses in your glasses and
00:51:30.079 lenses are neat because you can look at
00:51:31.720 things with them and sometimes things
00:51:33.640 look kind of fuzzy but then when you
00:51:35.400 bring it down a bit it gets really clear
00:51:38.240 and it becomes focused you can see a
00:51:40.480 nice clear picture with the lens well
00:51:42.440 right at the front of your eye is a lens
00:51:46.079 look at this it's got exactly the same
00:51:48.880 shape it's curved and when light goes
00:51:51.480 through that it can make Focus pictures
00:51:53.839 just like a magnifying glass can now you
00:51:55.480 can actually make a working model of
00:51:57.359 your eye with stuff you can find in your
00:51:59.240 kitchen here's something you might try
00:52:00.400 at home all you need is a tin can it's
00:52:03.880 going to be a tin can eye take the ends
00:52:06.160 out of both ends of it you need an
00:52:08.559 elastic band and a piece of waxed paper
00:52:13.480 and it's very easy to make you just put
00:52:15.440 the wax paper over one end of the can
00:52:18.240 like this and pull it down so that it
00:52:20.359 makes a nice tight drum and then just
00:52:24.119 hold it on with the elastic band so it's
00:52:27.319 nice and smooth like that and then you
00:52:31.680 put the magnifying glass in front and
00:52:33.359 you have an eye believe it or not now if
00:52:35.000 you want to see how it works come on
00:52:36.079 around behind me now eyes like to look
00:52:38.119 at something so let's look at something
00:52:39.559 interesting like Mr Bones over there we
00:52:42.000 hold the magnifying glass up
00:52:44.520 and wow there he is look at that he's
00:52:47.720 upside down down that's right he's
00:52:49.280 upside down and do you know that the
00:52:51.200 lens in your eye actually makes the
00:52:53.359 picture on the back of your eye upside
00:52:55.480 down but your brain turns it the right
00:52:57.559 way around but there's a full color
00:52:59.319 picture see now let's see if we can get
00:53:01.440 a real face over there Naomi do you want
00:53:02.920 to go stand beside Mr Bones and let's
00:53:04.839 see if we can see
00:53:06.760 Naomi oh there she is yeah see her how
00:53:10.200 you doing I wave the camera yeah there
00:53:12.559 she is nice standing on the
00:53:14.680 ceiling that's right so your eyes are
00:53:17.680 really complicated aren't they and
00:53:19.400 they're very delicate too and that's why
00:53:21.119 they need to be protected that's why you
00:53:22.920 have eyelashes these little hairs that
00:53:25.400 around your eyes while you have eyelids
00:53:27.400 so you can squint them closed to keep
00:53:29.160 out dust and dirt and even too much
00:53:31.240 light there are other things you can do
00:53:33.400 to protect your
00:53:35.200 eyes if you read in a dark place your
00:53:38.640 eyes become strained and they get tired
00:53:41.559 you might get a headache so always make
00:53:44.280 sure you have enough light when you
00:53:46.160 read and whenever you're making
00:53:48.200 something and pieces of wood or metal or
00:53:50.400 even paper might be flying around use
00:53:52.760 eye
00:53:53.680 protection it's the same when you play
00:53:55.760 sports or even when you're just mowing
00:53:57.640 the lawn if things are flying around
00:54:00.280 that could get into your eyes wear eye
00:54:03.200 protection because your eyes are very
00:54:05.400 soft you don't want to get anything in
00:54:07.280 them that could scratch
00:54:08.400 [Music]

00:54:40.559 yeah why did my eye cry when I got
00:54:43.040 something in it why did you cry well
00:54:45.280 that's your eye's way of washing itself
00:54:47.359 you know tears aren't Just For Crying
00:54:48.760 they're there all the time and they keep
00:54:50.000 your eye nice and moist and whenever
00:54:51.640 your eye feels something in it like a
00:54:53.079 piece of dirt or or this hair that you
00:54:54.760 got in there there and your eye turns
00:54:56.599 the tears on and the tears wash whatever

00:55:02.559 sometimes yeah absolutely see you you
00:55:06.319 know Sarah did the right thing in
00:55:07.480 telling me that she had something in her
00:55:08.960 eye if you ever get something in your
00:55:10.680 eye tell an adult and don't try to rub
00:55:13.520 it cuz that could actually make it
00:55:15.359 worse some people's eyes don't work very
00:55:17.920 well they see the world kind of fuzzy
00:55:20.240 like this so their eyes need help and
00:55:22.640 they put on glasses and the glass
00:55:25.079 glasses make everything
00:55:27.319 clear and they can see much
00:55:29.920 better your eye has many parts muscles
00:55:33.799 move your eyes up and down and from side
00:55:35.680 to side the iris opens and closes like a
00:55:39.559 window shade to control the amount of
00:55:42.039 light the hole in the middle of the iris
00:55:44.480 is called the
00:55:45.640 pupil the lens in your eye is clear and
00:55:48.520 curved it focuses the light on the back
00:55:51.039 of your eye from there a nerve carries
00:55:54.240 the message to the brain and you can
00:55:56.920 see everyone should have their eyes
00:56:00.000 tested glasses help many people see
00:56:03.160 better protect your eyes from anything
00:56:05.559 that could fly into
00:56:06.920 them make sure you have enough light
00:56:09.119 when you read and when you get something
