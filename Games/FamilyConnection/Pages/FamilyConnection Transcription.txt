00:45:20.700 points he did
00:45:23.099 um well we can't win them all but let's
00:45:24.839 give it another try though I'm sure
00:45:26.099 we'll do better next time okay dad let
00:45:28.740 me show you you take the highlighted
00:45:31.020 word and match it to the word on the
00:45:33.060 list that means the same thing they're
00:45:35.280 synonyms hey here's an idea how about if
00:45:38.220 we make up our own list of synonyms you
00:45:40.440 know answers that make sense to us and
00:45:42.480 then we'll see how many of our words
00:45:43.859 match those on that list oh
00:45:47.160 okay we'll just cover up these words and
00:45:49.859 make up a few of our own go ahead and
00:45:51.599 read the sentence the library will keep
00:45:53.940 the book for Sarah okay now what are
00:45:56.339 some words that have the same meaning as
00:45:57.839 keep
00:46:01.500 that's right let's see you know are
00:46:03.359 those words on the list
00:46:06.060 oh but maybe there's one that's close
00:46:10.079 hey I've got an idea how about if we
00:46:12.660 cover up the words we know don't mean
00:46:14.220 the same thing as keep that's good
00:46:16.260 thinking that way we narrow it down huh
00:46:18.480 I've got just the thing to help us out
