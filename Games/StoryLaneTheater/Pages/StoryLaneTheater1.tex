Here's the transcript reformatted as requested:

Come on in, settle back. It's curtain time at the Story Lane Theater. You've never seen a stage like this one. Anything can happen here. In a few minutes, we'll hear why all stories belong to Anansi, the trickster spider from Africa. But first, let's go to New York City for a backstage visit with Steven Guacha, the artist who drew the pictures for the show.

This studio, the place where I work, is the place I feel the happiest working. This is a place that I go to to just be with my imagination really, and therefore it's a place that I find a really fun place to make drawings. I just sit here at this desk, and I just have to look around a little bit and I start to have ideas for pictures.

When I was in second and third grade, I was sick with rheumatic fever and I was bedridden for a long time. So instead of going out, I didn't really have an opportunity to ride my bicycle or to play ball. I spent a lot of time looking and reading, watching. So books and animated cartoons, all sorts of drawn things, became the things that I lived with and I never stopped being interested in those things.

I carry a sketchbook with me everywhere, so the very first drawings of Anansi were made in this sketchbook. But they didn't even really look like Anansi, who's part person, part spider. His hair is a little more realistic, he's wearing eyeglasses that look like the kind of eyeglasses people really wear. None of those things seemed interesting or special enough.

So the next thing that I did was to work on the shapes of the character. I decided that instead of those realistic eyeglasses, he needed round circles. They looked a little bit more like eyes at the same time that they looked like eyeglasses. And I started to play with his beard and his hair, and I changed the soft floppy hat to a top hat which seemed more like a trickster's hat.

Anansi was a perfect chance to get everything I felt about bugs into a whole story. Anansi is a bug, he's a spider, but he's also a character. I wanted him basically to be a character that everybody, kids or grown-ups, thought was kind of cool. He doesn't always do the right thing, he doesn't always learn his lesson, but I think that his personality is really great. He's got a great sense of humor, he's always trying to succeed, and the fact that he doesn't succeed all the time I think just makes him all the more endearing, all the more charming.

The scene that I'm drawing right now is right before the hat-shaking dance that Anansi performs. Of course, he performs it because he's got a hat full of hot, hot beans that he's just plumped down on his head. The beans are hot, hotter than anything he's ever experienced, and his hair is acting like bolts of lightning shooting off of his head. His eyes are bulging out of his head about to pop and his teeth are clenched. In the next scene, his eyes are going to do a kind of spiral like this. That's when things get really hot and you won't be able to even see straight.

If I had to come up with one important thing that I told kids, it would be to do the things that you love to do the most, whether that's taking care of animals or playing sports or drawing or reading. Whatever it is, I think you do the things best that you love doing. I've spent my life doing the one thing that I love to do more than anything, which is to draw, make pictures. And I don't think you can go wrong if you do what you like.

Thanks, Stephen. And now let's head for Jamaica to hear two stories from Anansi, the owner of all stories.

Long, long time ago there was nothing in this world. Then there were fishes in the sea, then there were animals in the bush. And in the beginning, there was one place. Africa was that place. Then there were people. Then people, in the beginning when this world was new, they told stories. Africa stories. Them tell stories about things they see, them tell stories about things they think, them tell stories about things they dream. Yeah man, them people tell stories all the time.

Then one day a terrible thing happened. Many, many of those people get taken away from them home in Africa. Men make them slaves, men bring them in ships and take them to Jamaica to work. Ah, sad sad thing. Them work hard in Jamaica on the sugar plantations. It's tough going there, but them remember them old stories. You see, them bring the old stories with them. Them people in Jamaica still tell them stories. Them tell about Anansi the spider.

Now Anansi, him teeny teeny but him smart. How else him get all stories name for him? You see, Anansi own all stories. When your mother tell you story or your grandfather tell you story, them borrow Anansi story. All stories belong to Anansi.

Now stories not always belong to Anansi. In the beginning, all stories Tiger stories. Tiger him own all stories because him biggest and strongest animal in the bush. Tiger him own everything in the bush. Anansi the tiniest in the bush, him own nothing. When him whisper, no one hear. When him holler, others in the bush they just all laugh at him.

One day Anansi decide to go ask for something to be named for him. So Anansi go to home of Tiger. When him come to Tiger, Anansi bow so low him forehead touch the ground. Him say, "Everything name for you Tiger, and how come nothing name for me? We give your name to everything: Tiger Lily, Tiger Moss, Tiger stories, Tiger this, Tiger that. But nothing bears me name."

"That's true," Tiger say. "You want something named for you? Is that what you say?"

"Yeah man," Anansi say.

"What you want?" Tiger say.

"I want all stories be name for me," Anansi say.

So Tiger, him think to himself, "I trick this boy. I make a joke on Anansi." That cool. Tiger say, "That cool, man. I name stories for you. But first, there's a little thing I ask for." Tiger say, "Bring to me Snake him that live by river. Bring him to me alive on Saturday. Then you have the stories."

See now, all the animals in the bush, they all laugh now because Tiger him make fool out of Anansi. Snake is big big big big and Anansi the spider him teeny teeny teeny. Cling cling bird laugh big belly laugh. Frog him laugh too, and Monkey him jump backwards over and over him laugh so hard.

Anansi no care. Snake him too small, and him say, "That the deal, man. I bring you Snake Saturday, them all stories name for me." So Anansi leave home. Him hear laugh in the bush. Wherever him go, all creatures big and small just laugh at him. Tiger trick Anansi.

Now this was Monday. On Tuesday, Anansi get big idea. Him think it a marvelous idea. Anansi decide to build a calabash to catch Snake. So him take strong strong vine and make a noose. Him hide vine in grass. Him set some berries that Snake love best in noose. Then Anansi wait and wait, and Snake come slither down through the bush and him see the berries. "Berries to be my dinner," Snake say. So Snake lay across the vine and eat them berries.

Now Anansi pulls hard on the noose, but Snake too heavy. Anansi pull and pull and pull, but it no good. Calabash fell. Snake eat all them berries and Snake go home.

Wednesday, Anansi get big big idea. "This one work," Anansi said. "Today me catch Snake." So Anansi dig deep deep hole by side of road and then put grease on side and bottom of hole and make it nasty and slippery. On the bottom him put six banana. Now Snake, him love banana. Anansi think Snake go in slippery hole for banana and him can't get out 'cause him side too slick. "This do the trick, this do the trick." So Anansi him hide in the bush beside the road to wait.

And Snake come slithering down the road. Him hungry for dinner. Snake see them bananas at bottom of hole. Him know side slip slide from grease, so him wrap tail around trunk of tree. Then Snake reach down in a hole and get bananas. When him finish eating, him pull himself out of hole with him tail. Snake him just crawl away, him belly full with Anansi's bananas. Anansi no had no bananas. Anansi no have Snake.

Thursday, Anansi get big big big biggest idea of all. Him decide to make a fly-up and catch Snake. "Yeah, fly-up catch a snake," Anansi say. "Snake put him head in trap and go up, catch him good." So Anansi builds fly-up. Inside trap, Anansi put one egg for bait. "Oh, would the Snake feel happy when him see egg."

Snake just lift him head and stand up. Him bend over and snatch egg real easy right out a trap and not even touch the trap. Not even fly-up could catch Snake.

Friday morning coming. Anansi worried. Snake him take all of Anansi food and Anansi no catch Snake. "Too hard luck," Anansi say. So Anansi him think all day Friday. Him sit on pebble and think hard how him catch Snake, but nothing come to him. Anansi going to lose deal with Tiger.

Saturday morning come and this day Tiger want Snake or stories be named for Anansi. But Anansi have no way to catch Snake. This look bad for Anansi. Yeah man.

Anansi feel like walk down by river. Him go there and him think. Today Anansi come to Snake hole. Snake watching sun come up. Snake him head out of hole but him body in the hole.

"Ah, Anansi! Me very angry with you, man," Snake say. "All week you try and catch me. First the calabash, then the slippery hole, and yesterday the fly-up. Me have a good mind to eat you up."

"Snake, yeah, but me just try and prove to you longest thing in the world," Anansi say.

"Yeah, but everybody know me longest thing in the world," Snake say.

Anansi know him got plan now and just keep on talking, tell him own story. "Uh, Snake," Anansi say, "you longer them bamboo tree over there? Me think not."

Now Snake got him big big pride. Him say, "I bigger than biggest bamboo." So Anansi him go chop bamboo tree with him teeny teeny machete. He put it near Snake hole.

"Me don't think so," Snake. Anansi say, "Why don't you come out of that hole and see yourself?"

Now Snake him know him long. Him move quick to prove it to Anansi. Snake him lay on top of bamboo.

"No, I don't think so," Anansi say.

"Bamboo longer," look at Snake.

And Snake see that bamboo a little longer because him tail curl up at end so it look like bamboo longer.

"Stretch me tail to bamboo, Anansi. It curl at the end. It need to be straight. Tie it tight."

So Anansi do what Snake say. Him tie Snake's tail to bamboo. Now Cling Cling Bird him see what go on and him call the other animals to watch. Frog come, Monkey come, even Tiger come.

"Just proving me point," Anansi say to them animal. Him give eye wink to him all. "Though Snake, you're long but you curl up even at your belly," Anansi say.

"Then tie me there too and tie it tight. Me show you me longer than them bamboo."

So Anansi do what Snake say. Him tie Snake belly to bamboo. Them animals all watching. Anansi say, "Peep! Them not believe them eyes what them see."

"Snake, you're still shorter them bamboo," Anansi say.

"Not much though, about six inch," Snake be angry.

"I think you can do it," Anansi say. "You got to stretch hard man. You got to stretch so hard that your skin pull up and your eyes close. Make yourself longer man, stretch long."

Snake say, "All them animals stretch long." And Snake stretch long. Him keep stretching and them animal call to him, "You winning, Snake! You're almost longer than the bamboo!"

Snake stretch so hard him eyes closed like Anansi want. When him close eyes, Anansi tie Snake head to bamboo. Anansi done it. Him catch Snake. Snake tied up on bamboo ready for Tiger.

Tiger and them animal all be silent. Anansi, this teeny teeny thing, catch big big Snake his self. So now Tiger come close to Anansi. Him tail move back and forth. Snake on bamboo beside them. Tiger him say nothing. Him just keep walking in a bush. Tiger him look back at Anansi from over his shoulder. Him nod in the direction of Anansi. Him say nothing but we all know what look mean. With him eyes, Tiger say, "You win, boy. All stories now belong to you."

And Anansi, after that, nobody dare call them Tiger stories no more. Anansi win the stories. They belong to Anansi. Cousin, that Snake. All stories belong to Anansi. Even this one. Yeah man.

Now, one time story get Anansi into trouble. This story is so big it make Anansi the spider bald. This true, man. Look at Anansi now. Him got no hair on him head. Him bald like this. How it happened:

Anansi mother-in-law died. Sad time for him wife. So Anansi sent her to funeral without him. Anansi say to him wife, "What good, wifey? Me soon come to mother-in-law funeral." Anansi got to think hard, man. Him big big man. Him stay home to figure out how him going to be special at funeral.

So after wife go, Anansi think how him going to show him big sadness at mother-in-law funeral. "Everyone need a funeral maybe different. Ah, eat for seven days," Anansi say. "This would show me have most sorrow at mother-in-law funeral. Make me big big man."

But first, before he go, he meet everything in him house. Him eat for 3 hours. Plantain, yam, everything and meat. Anansi eat so much he get big tummy. Eh-eh, him belly full man.

Then Anansi go to mother-in-law funeral. After Anansi mother-in-law buried, them animals say, "Eat, Anansi, eat. You have a long trip. You must eat."

"What kind of man eat after mother-in-law buried?" The Anansi say, "Me no eat to show me sorrow. Me eat on the eighth day."

So Anansi no eat. Them animals think him sad. Nobody before starve because mother-in-law buried. Animals think him good mind to show him respect.

Second day come and Anansi eat nothing. All the animals say, "Eat, Anansi. You must eat."

"What kind of man eat after mother-in-law buried?" The Anansi say, "Me eat on the eighth day."

Now them other animals eat feast, man. And Anansi him just watch. Him get prouder second by second.

Third day come and Anansi eat nothing. Them man say, "Eat, Anansi. You don't need to stop."

"What kind of man eat after him mother-in-law buried?" The Anansi say, "Me eat on the eighth day."

But this getting hard for Anansi. Three days a long time to go without no food. Him starve to death. Him belly hurt so hungry. Him watch animals eat them meal. Him him him watch Monkey eat rice and Anansi can taste it in his own mouth. Anansi so hungry him dream of food at night when he sleep.

Fourth day come and Anansi head spinning around and round. Him so hungry. All the animals still sleep, so Anansi go for a walk to take him mind off food. Anansi walking, him see pot of beans cooking on fire. Real hot. He can't control himself. He go right for them beans. He going to eat there. Ain't nobody here. For better for worse, he going to eat now.

So Anansi stick the spoon in the pot and snatch beans and stuff them in his mouth. He eat fast fast fast fast fast. Him so hungry. Anansi stick spoon in a pot again. Ah, this time he think better. Him think can take beans to the bush and eat them in peace and quiet so nobody see him eating. But when he lift the spoon out of the pot, he hear the other ones coming. Pig, Rabbit, Dog, Cling Cling Bird, and Monkey come walking toward them beans and Anansi.

Anansi think quick. He poured them hot hot beans into him hat. Then Anansi put that hat with them hot beans on him head. The man will say, "Eat, Anansi. You must eat." But Anansi still go on with him story. "What kind of man eat after mother-in-law buried? Me eat on the eighth day." But this time is different. Them beans burning him head bad, man. Heat so strong, Anansi's eyes popping out of him head.

So Anansi take his hat and move it forward and backward, side to side. But he getting worse. On Anansi's head him jump and shake about, getting real lively. Him do this so much funny.

"What you doing with your hat, Dam man?" Dog say. "You got honey bee in there?"

Anansi him got another story him tell. "Ah, today is a day of hot shaking dance in village where I grew up," Anansi say. "It's great dance. We do it like I do." And Anansi shaking and dancing all over, just jiggling him hat all about. He can't stand still. The beans so hot he burning up under his hat.

"Um, me me must go to village and do the hat shaking dance with me people," Anansi say. "See, festival too much fun to miss. They need me there."

So Anansi pushed through all them animals, shaking and jiggling him hat. He moving real quick to get out of there. Smoke coming out of him hat, him head burn so bad.

"But you must eat, Anansi," them animals say. And Anansi take off in a big hurry. "Before your journey, you must eat. What kind of man eat after him mother-in-law buried?" Anansi say.

Anansi run quick like, but them animals still behind them. They still beg them to eat. "Eat, Anansi," them animal say. "You must eat."

Hot beans hurt Anansi's head bad. Anansi just think about getting that hat off him head. Him can't stand it no more. So Anansi take him hat off and them hot hot beans come tumbling down all over him head and face.

Them animals seen beans dripping on Anansi's head. Pigs seen it, Rabbits seen it, Dogs seen it, Cling Cling Bird seen it, and Monkey seen it. Them stop right there in the tracks. They know Anansi ain't no big man. Him say him no eat out of respect for him mother-in-law, but him eat all along. Him telling stories again.

"Such a big man," Monkey said.

"Oh no, no, no, me can't eat," said Cling Cling Bird in a mocking voice like Anansi. "What kind of man eat after him mother-in-law buried?"

Well, them animals all laugh big at Anansi. They scorn him and jeer him. Anansi him run away from them. Him ashamed that him tell story and get caught. Him run in bush to clean him head, and he rub all them beans off him head.

Now when Anansi rub beans from his head, him feel no hair there no more. On top of him head shiny. Them beans burn him hair right off him head. Now this make Anansi be more ashamed. Him go back home and think some more. Him sit in him web and think long long time about him mistake.

To this day, Anansi the spider still bald. Yeah man, bald like mango. So if you tell Anansi story, you tell the good story, not the bad one. You no want your head to be bald like Anansi. If you tell the bad one, tell the good Anansi story all the time. Yeah.

Here's the transcript reformatted as requested:

Come on in, settle back. It's curtain time at the Story Lane Theater. You've never seen a stage like this one. Anything can happen here. In a few minutes, we'll hear why all stories belong to Anansi, the trickster spider from Africa. But first, let's go to New York City for a backstage visit with Steven Guacha, the artist who drew the pictures for the show.

This studio, the place where I work, is the place I feel the happiest working. This is a place that I go to to just be with my imagination really, and therefore it's a place that I find a really fun place to make drawings. I just sit here at this desk, and I just have to look around a little bit and I start to have ideas for pictures.

When I was in second and third grade, I was sick with rheumatic fever and I was bedridden for a long time. So instead of going out, I didn't really have an opportunity to ride my bicycle or to play ball. I spent a lot of time looking and reading, watching. So books and animated cartoons, all sorts of drawn things, became the things that I lived with and I never stopped being interested in those things.

I carry a sketchbook with me everywhere, so the very first drawings of Anansi were made in this sketchbook. But they didn't even really look like Anansi, who's part person, part spider. His hair is a little more realistic, he's wearing eyeglasses that look like the kind of eyeglasses people really wear. None of those things seemed interesting or special enough.

So the next thing that I did was to work on the shapes of the character. I decided that instead of those realistic eyeglasses, he needed round circles. They looked a little bit more like eyes at the same time that they looked like eyeglasses. And I started to play with his beard and his hair, and I changed the soft floppy hat to a top hat which seemed more like a trickster's hat.

Anansi was a perfect chance to get everything I felt about bugs into a whole story. Anansi is a bug, he's a spider, but he's also a character. I wanted him basically to be a character that everybody, kids or grown-ups, thought was kind of cool. He doesn't always do the right thing, he doesn't always learn his lesson, but I think that his personality is really great. He's got a great sense of humor, he's always trying to succeed, and the fact that he doesn't succeed all the time I think just makes him all the more endearing, all the more charming.

The scene that I'm drawing right now is right before the hat-shaking dance that Anansi performs. Of course, he performs it because he's got a hat full of hot, hot beans that he's just plumped down on his head. The beans are hot, hotter than anything he's ever experienced, and his hair is acting like bolts of lightning shooting off of his head. His eyes are bulging out of his head about to pop and his teeth are clenched. In the next scene, his eyes are going to do a kind of spiral like this. That's when things get really hot and you won't be able to even see straight.

If I had to come up with one important thing that I told kids, it would be to do the things that you love to do the most, whether that's taking care of animals or playing sports or drawing or reading. Whatever it is, I think you do the things best that you love doing. I've spent my life doing the one thing that I love to do more than anything, which is to draw, make pictures. And I don't think you can go wrong if you do what you like.

Thanks, Stephen. And now let's head for Jamaica to hear two stories from Anansi, the owner of all stories.

Long, long time ago there was nothing in this world. Then there were fishes in the sea, then there were animals in the bush. And in the beginning, there was one place. Africa was that place. Then there were people. Then people, in the beginning when this world was new, they told stories. Africa stories. Them tell stories about things they see, them tell stories about things they think, them tell stories about things they dream. Yeah man, them people tell stories all the time.

Then one day a terrible thing happened. Many, many of those people get taken away from them home in Africa. Men make them slaves, men bring them in ships and take them to Jamaica to work. Ah, sad sad thing. Them work hard in Jamaica on the sugar plantations. It's tough going there, but them remember them old stories. You see, them bring the old stories with them. Them people in Jamaica still tell them stories. Them tell about Anansi the spider.

Now Anansi, him teeny teeny but him smart. How else him get all stories name for him? You see, Anansi own all stories. When your mother tell you story or your grandfather tell you story, them borrow Anansi story. All stories belong to Anansi.

Now stories not always belong to Anansi. In the beginning, all stories Tiger stories. Tiger him own all stories because him biggest and strongest animal in the bush. Tiger him own everything in the bush. Anansi the tiniest in the bush, him own nothing. When him whisper, no one hear. When him holler, others in the bush they just all laugh at him.

One day Anansi decide to go ask for something to be named for him. So Anansi go to home of Tiger. When him come to Tiger, Anansi bow so low him forehead touch the ground. Him say, "Everything name for you Tiger, and how come nothing name for me? We give your name to everything: Tiger Lily, Tiger Moss, Tiger stories, Tiger this, Tiger that. But nothing bears me name."

"That's true," Tiger say. "You want something named for you? Is that what you say?"

"Yeah man," Anansi say.

"What you want?" Tiger say.

"I want all stories be name for me," Anansi say.

So Tiger, him think to himself, "I trick this boy. I make a joke on Anansi." That cool. Tiger say, "That cool, man. I name stories for you. But first, there's a little thing I ask for." Tiger say, "Bring to me Snake him that live by river. Bring him to me alive on Saturday. Then you have the stories."

See now, all the animals in the bush, they all laugh now because Tiger him make fool out of Anansi. Snake is big big big big and Anansi the spider him teeny teeny teeny. Cling cling bird laugh big belly laugh. Frog him laugh too, and Monkey him jump backwards over and over him laugh so hard.

Anansi no care. Snake him too small, and him say, "That the deal, man. I bring you Snake Saturday, them all stories name for me." So Anansi leave home. Him hear laugh in the bush. Wherever him go, all creatures big and small just laugh at him. Tiger trick Anansi.

Now this was Monday. On Tuesday, Anansi get big idea. Him think it a marvelous idea. Anansi decide to build a calabash to catch Snake. So him take strong strong vine and make a noose. Him hide vine in grass. Him set some berries that Snake love best in noose. Then Anansi wait and wait, and Snake come slither down through the bush and him see the berries. "Berries to be my dinner," Snake say. So Snake lay across the vine and eat them berries.

Now Anansi pulls hard on the noose, but Snake too heavy. Anansi pull and pull and pull, but it no good. Calabash fell. Snake eat all them berries and Snake go home.

Wednesday, Anansi get big big idea. "This one work," Anansi said. "Today me catch Snake." So Anansi dig deep deep hole by side of road and then put grease on side and bottom of hole and make it nasty and slippery. On the bottom him put six banana. Now Snake, him love banana. Anansi think Snake go in slippery hole for banana and him can't get out 'cause him side too slick. "This do the trick, this do the trick." So Anansi him hide in the bush beside the road to wait.

And Snake come slithering down the road. Him hungry for dinner. Snake see them bananas at bottom of hole. Him know side slip slide from grease, so him wrap tail around trunk of tree. Then Snake reach down in a hole and get bananas. When him finish eating, him pull himself out of hole with him tail. Snake him just crawl away, him belly full with Anansi's bananas. Anansi no had no bananas. Anansi no have Snake.

Thursday, Anansi get big big big biggest idea of all. Him decide to make a fly-up and catch Snake. "Yeah, fly-up catch a snake," Anansi say. "Snake put him head in trap and go up, catch him good." So Anansi builds fly-up. Inside trap, Anansi put one egg for bait. "Oh, would the Snake feel happy when him see egg."

Snake just lift him head and stand up. Him bend over and snatch egg real easy right out a trap and not even touch the trap. Not even fly-up could catch Snake.

Friday morning coming. Anansi worried. Snake him take all of Anansi food and Anansi no catch Snake. "Too hard luck," Anansi say. So Anansi him think all day Friday. Him sit on pebble and think hard how him catch Snake, but nothing come to him. Anansi going to lose deal with Tiger.

Saturday morning come and this day Tiger want Snake or stories be named for Anansi. But Anansi have no way to catch Snake. This look bad for Anansi. Yeah man.

Anansi feel like walk down by river. Him go there and him think. Today Anansi come to Snake hole. Snake watching sun come up. Snake him head out of hole but him body in the hole.

"Ah, Anansi! Me very angry with you, man," Snake say. "All week you try and catch me. First the calabash, then the slippery hole, and yesterday the fly-up. Me have a good mind to eat you up."

"Snake, yeah, but me just try and prove to you longest thing in the world," Anansi say.

"Yeah, but everybody know me longest thing in the world," Snake say.

Anansi know him got plan now and just keep on talking, tell him own story. "Uh, Snake," Anansi say, "you longer them bamboo tree over there? Me think not."

Now Snake got him big big pride. Him say, "I bigger than biggest bamboo." So Anansi him go chop bamboo tree with him teeny teeny machete. He put it near Snake hole.

"Me don't think so," Snake. Anansi say, "Why don't you come out of that hole and see yourself?"

Now Snake him know him long. Him move quick to prove it to Anansi. Snake him lay on top of bamboo.

"No, I don't think so," Anansi say.

"Bamboo longer," look at Snake.

And Snake see that bamboo a little longer because him tail curl up at end so it look like bamboo longer.

"Stretch me tail to bamboo, Anansi. It curl at the end. It need to be straight. Tie it tight."

So Anansi do what Snake say. Him tie Snake's tail to bamboo. Now Cling Cling Bird him see what go on and him call the other animals to watch. Frog come, Monkey come, even Tiger come.

"Just proving me point," Anansi say to them animal. Him give eye wink to him all. "Though Snake, you're long but you curl up even at your belly," Anansi say.

"Then tie me there too and tie it tight. Me show you me longer than them bamboo."

So Anansi do what Snake say. Him tie Snake belly to bamboo. Them animals all watching. Anansi say, "Peep! Them not believe them eyes what them see."

"Snake, you're still shorter them bamboo," Anansi say.

"Not much though, about six inch," Snake be angry.

"I think you can do it," Anansi say. "You got to stretch hard man. You got to stretch so hard that your skin pull up and your eyes close. Make yourself longer man, stretch long."

Snake say, "All them animals stretch long." And Snake stretch long. Him keep stretching and them animal call to him, "You winning, Snake! You're almost longer than the bamboo!"

Snake stretch so hard him eyes closed like Anansi want. When him close eyes, Anansi tie Snake head to bamboo. Anansi done it. Him catch Snake. Snake tied up on bamboo ready for Tiger.

Tiger and them animal all be silent. Anansi, this teeny teeny thing, catch big big Snake his self. So now Tiger come close to Anansi. Him tail move back and forth. Snake on bamboo beside them. Tiger him say nothing. Him just keep walking in a bush. Tiger him look back at Anansi from over his shoulder. Him nod in the direction of Anansi. Him say nothing but we all know what look mean. With him eyes, Tiger say, "You win, boy. All stories now belong to you."

And Anansi, after that, nobody dare call them Tiger stories no more. Anansi win the stories. They belong to Anansi. Cousin, that Snake. All stories belong to Anansi. Even this one. Yeah man.

Now, one time story get Anansi into trouble. This story is so big it make Anansi the spider bald. This true, man. Look at Anansi now. Him got no hair on him head. Him bald like this. How it happened:

Anansi mother-in-law died. Sad time for him wife. So Anansi sent her to funeral without him. Anansi say to him wife, "What good, wifey? Me soon come to mother-in-law funeral." Anansi got to think hard, man. Him big big man. Him stay home to figure out how him going to be special at funeral.

So after wife go, Anansi think how him going to show him big sadness at mother-in-law funeral. "Everyone need a funeral maybe different. Ah, eat for seven days," Anansi say. "This would show me have most sorrow at mother-in-law funeral. Make me big big man."

But first, before he go, he meet everything in him house. Him eat for 3 hours. Plantain, yam, everything and meat. Anansi eat so much he get big tummy. Eh-eh, him belly full man.

Then Anansi go to mother-in-law funeral. After Anansi mother-in-law buried, them animals say, "Eat, Anansi, eat. You have a long trip. You must eat."

"What kind of man eat after mother-in-law buried?" The Anansi say, "Me no eat to show me sorrow. Me eat on the eighth day."

So Anansi no eat. Them animals think him sad. Nobody before starve because mother-in-law buried. Animals think him good mind to show him respect.

Second day come and Anansi eat nothing. All the animals say, "Eat, Anansi. You must eat."

"What kind of man eat after mother-in-law buried?" The Anansi say, "Me eat on the eighth day."

Now them other animals eat feast, man. And Anansi him just watch. Him get prouder second by second.

Third day come and Anansi eat nothing. Them man say, "Eat, Anansi. You don't need to stop."

"What kind of man eat after him mother-in-law buried?" The Anansi say, "Me eat on the eighth day."

But this getting hard for Anansi. Three days a long time to go without no food. Him starve to death. Him belly hurt so hungry. Him watch animals eat them meal. Him him him watch Monkey eat rice and Anansi can taste it in his own mouth. Anansi so hungry him dream of food at night when he sleep.

Fourth day come and Anansi head spinning around and round. Him so hungry. All the animals still sleep, so Anansi go for a walk to take him mind off food. Anansi walking, him see pot of beans cooking on fire. Real hot. He can't control himself. He go right for them beans. He going to eat there. Ain't nobody here. For better for worse, he going to eat now.

So Anansi stick the spoon in the pot and snatch beans and stuff them in his mouth. He eat fast fast fast fast fast. Him so hungry. Anansi stick spoon in a pot again. Ah, this time he think better. Him think can take beans to the bush and eat them in peace and quiet so nobody see him eating. But when he lift the spoon out of the pot, he hear the other ones coming. Pig, Rabbit, Dog, Cling Cling Bird, and Monkey come walking toward them beans and Anansi.

Anansi think quick. He poured them hot hot beans into him hat. Then Anansi put

"I, I, I tried to get here soon as I could. It's the Lord's truth, you see. I had so much meat for you that I couldn't carry it all by myself, so I stashed it away. And if you'll follow me, I can take you to it."

Boss Lion looked as if he were about to pounce on Br'er Rabbit and gobble him up right there, so Br'er Rabbit had to do some mighty lickety-split fast talking.

"Look, look, look here, look here, Boss Lion," he pleaded. "I'm just a teeny rabbit. I'd only be an appetizer. Big lion like you, why, I wouldn't be an appetizer. I'd be just a bite of fur and bones. You couldn't even put me on a cracker, I'm so small. But if you want a whole lot of meat, a great big pile of fresh, juicy steaks, I promise I'll show you. I promise!"

"Take me to the meat, and it better be enough, or I'll eat you right now."

And so they took off together through the woods to Br'er Rabbit's farm. When they reached Br'er Rabbit's well, he opened the door, looked in, and fell backwards as if he was stung by a honeybee.

"Lord Almighty!" he yelled to Boss Lion. "There's some big critter in there, and he's eating your meat!"

Boss Lion pushed Br'er Rabbit aside and stuck his head in the well. "Who are you?" he growled down into the deep well, and a few seconds later his echo came back up: "Who are you?"

Now old Boss Lion was not used to being talked back to, seeing he was the king of the forest and all, and when he heard the voice boiling back up from the well, he grew awfully angry and roared back down, "Who am I? I says who are you!" And once again the voice came back: "Who am I? I says who are you!"

Boss Lion was now turning strawberry red with rage, huffing and snorting and growling. And just then Br'er Rabbit poked him in the side. "You hear him sass you?" he said. "That lion down there is eating your meat and making a mockery out of you. You going to take that from him?"

"Why, curse his pile of fresh meat-stealing soul! I'll whoop that lion down there myself if he has the guts to get up here!"

Boss Lion looked into the well again and saw a lion staring right back up at him, a mean and ugly lion, and he yelled at it, "I'm going to get you!" And it yelled directly back at him, "I'm going to get you!"

And this was just about all Boss Lion could handle. "Step back, Rabbit. That cat's dead meat!" And with that, Boss Lion took a flying leap right into that well. There was a great crash, deep inside could plunge, and as soon as Br'er Rabbit heard it, he slammed the lid shut and locked it.

After a few seconds of silence, he took out his cap, cocked it on his head, and pulled out his old cigar. And he sauntered off into town at a leisurely pace while the last wisps of sunlight were softening over the forest.

When he got near the village, all the folks was standing around debating who was going to feed Boss Lion next. And when they saw Br'er Rabbit coming down the road in the glow, they thought for sure he was a ghost and started running to save their souls. But Br'er Rabbit stopped them and told them he was no ghost, and as soon as they realized it was so, they asked him all excited, "Did, did Boss Lion eat you up?"

"Huh? He who up?" Br'er Rabbit asked back. "Me? No, ain't no confounded lion come near to these naps of mine."

"What, what did he say?" the folks asked. "What, what did he do? Won't he come eat us all up now?"

And at that, Br'er Rabbit laughed and explained to them what he had done. Well, he changed the story around a little and said that when Boss Lion started getting rough with him, he simply beat the living kidneys out of him as he had promised he would, and threw him into the well.

And though most folks didn't believe him at first, he later showed them the well and the drowned troublemaker at the bottom, so they had to believe him. And for many, many years afterwards, Br'er Rabbit was a hero in those parts along the Mississippi River. People told stories about him and sang his praises for acres around.

And things were pretty peaceable once more in Br'er Village, except for a few small scrapes here and there and maybe a minor spat now and then. But as long as anyone can remember, no Boss Lions ever came by again to bother the folks of Br'er Village.
