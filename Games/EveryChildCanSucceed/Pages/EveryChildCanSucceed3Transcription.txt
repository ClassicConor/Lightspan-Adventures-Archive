00:00:44.719 expect excellence one of the things that
00:00:47.760 i know
00:00:48.239 as a parent and as a teacher is that no
00:00:50.800 one rises to low expectations
00:00:53.680 expect excellence every day okay this
00:00:56.480 group one two three six five eight
00:01:00.160 two three very good
00:01:03.760 expect excellence from every student we
00:01:06.720 demand
00:01:07.760 the very best we demand that they
00:01:10.159 achieve
00:01:11.200 and they do
00:01:12.870 
00:01:50.960 comments overheard in the teacher's
00:01:52.720 lounge you're having trouble with alan
00:01:55.439 well i'm not surprised i mean he is
00:01:57.920 mike's brother
00:02:00.159 higher order thinking skills forget it
00:02:03.119 these kids need to learn the basics
00:02:08.160 look around most people don't expect
00:02:11.038 much from the kids who live here
00:02:13.260 
00:02:14.879 fortunately educators at highly
00:02:17.120 successful schools
00:02:18.400 see things differently the perception of
00:02:21.200 a school in south dallas or in any
00:02:23.440 inner city area in an urban school
00:02:25.760 district is that
00:02:26.720 inner city kids cannot learn that they
00:02:29.040 are deficient
00:02:30.160 in some way and i'm here to
00:02:33.840 to make sure that that is a myth
00:02:36.879 that it is not true absolutely not true
00:02:40.000 my kids do as well or better than kids
00:02:43.040 just about anywhere
00:02:44.080 in this country i can put up my top kids
00:02:47.280 against the top kids
00:02:48.560 just about anywhere and i know that
00:02:51.040 they'll do well
00:02:52.239 some teachers will say you know where
00:02:54.160 someone's always doing the best they can
00:02:56.400 and when a student realizes that you
00:02:59.200 don't expect much out of them they won't
00:03:00.879 give you anything
00:03:01.920 but if you expect a lot of out of them
00:03:04.959 and help them and guide them then
00:03:06.400 they'll give you exactly what you want
00:03:08.180 
00:03:15.120 i am not an underachiever you're an over
00:03:18.640 expector
00:03:19.360 
00:03:22.800 at the schools we visited high
00:03:24.640 expectations were an essential part of
00:03:26.879 the school's culture
00:03:29.200 everything the educators do is infused
00:03:31.680 with their belief
00:03:32.799 that all students will succeed
00:03:36.480 but how do they communicate these high
00:03:38.239 expectations
00:03:39.680 and how do they help children meet them
00:03:42.159 it will take them about seven to ten
00:03:43.920 days to become
00:03:44.959 a butterfly before we see him and he'll
00:03:47.040 do just as well that way
00:03:48.799 as they do hanging i want all your
00:03:52.239 papers to be nice and deep just like
00:03:54.000 that
00:03:54.959 that's lovely one way to convey high
00:03:58.000 expectations is by monitoring
00:04:00.000 student progress monitoring helps
00:04:02.720 communicate the school's high
00:04:04.159 expectations
00:04:05.280 and insistence on academic excellence at
00:04:08.319 the van school in pittsburgh
00:04:10.000 principal doris brevard is a constant
00:04:12.560 presence in the classroom
00:04:14.959 does your g look like the g up there on
00:04:17.759 the board
00:04:19.519 i expect the children to do their very
00:04:21.680 best
00:04:22.720 in every written assignment so i'm
00:04:25.360 looking forward to a letter from you
00:04:27.919 using
00:04:28.479 cursive writing in every test
00:04:31.840 and every recitation i expect the very
00:04:35.360 best george you're improving
00:04:43.919 another way to communicate and achieve
00:04:46.000 high expectations
00:04:47.440 is to create a supportive learning
00:04:49.199 environment
00:04:50.639 at euclid avenue elementary in los
00:04:52.639 angeles principal esther mcshane
00:04:55.040 inherited a school that was unruly
00:04:57.680 unsafe
00:04:58.639 and covered with graffiti you need to
00:05:01.360 model these things you need to model the
00:05:03.280 expectations
00:05:04.639 i needed to change some of the staff
00:05:06.800 members and the
00:05:08.080 custodial staff to bring change let's
00:05:10.639 see what else and my model to them
00:05:12.400 as it is for the secretarial staff or
00:05:15.039 any support step
00:05:16.320 is that we must provide an environment
00:05:19.919 where teachers will want to come where
00:05:22.560 kids want to come where parents want to
00:05:24.720 come
00:05:25.360 because it's clean it's neat it's
00:05:28.080 orderly
00:05:29.120 somebody truly cares and if somebody
00:05:31.680 shows you that they truly care
00:05:33.280 then people begin to feel they're
00:05:35.120 important i'm important
00:05:37.440 i can live up to whatever she thinks i'm
00:05:39.919 capable of doing
00:05:41.280 watch ourselves when we do that the
00:05:43.360 other thing were they not making
00:05:44.800 making fun of your size so what are you
00:05:47.199 going to ask me
00:05:48.479 can i make fun of my size and what does
00:05:50.320 that call to have what
00:05:53.039 right okay you have a right you have a
00:05:55.199 right to ask people to respect you
00:05:58.960 a positive learning environment is also
00:06:01.120 a priority at bennett q
00:06:02.880 school in inglewood california principal
00:06:06.080 nancy ishinaga makes this a safe haven
00:06:08.400 for students
00:06:10.639 first of all we believe that the school
00:06:12.479 must be a safe place
00:06:14.479 for all kids in other words the streets
00:06:17.199 may be dangerous
00:06:18.639 but the school must be safe and so we
00:06:21.440 have some strict
00:06:22.560 rules for example there is to be no
00:06:24.160 fighting if a kid gets involved in a
00:06:26.080 fight there are serious consequences
00:06:28.160 so we really don't have very many fights
00:06:34.960 firm discipline is also a given at rice
00:06:37.600 school in south dallas
00:06:39.440 the school's motto says it all excellent
00:06:42.400 academics
00:06:43.440 excellent behavior i firmly believe
00:06:46.639 that behavior comes first in order for
00:06:49.840 kids to learn they must know how to
00:06:51.759 behave in school
00:06:52.960 they must know how to come in school sit
00:06:56.160 listen to the teacher in order to learn
00:06:59.120 no
00:06:59.440 child can learn if they're talking when
00:07:01.680 the teacher is talking they miss out on
00:07:03.440 too much
00:07:04.400 so the first thing we that we work on in
00:07:07.280 these schools
00:07:08.400 is behavior and we work on that
00:07:11.520 right along with academics mama pulled
00:07:14.319 the tray of biscuits from the oven and
00:07:16.240 placed it on the counter
00:07:17.919 in time she murmured all in good time
00:07:21.360 effective school leaders create school
00:07:23.440 policies and practices
00:07:24.880 that help them accomplish their high
00:07:26.639 expectations grandma
00:07:28.080 then picked up tonya's empty glass and
00:07:30.560 went
00:07:31.440 when louise smith became principal at
00:07:33.360 rice one of the first things she did was
00:07:35.680 demand
00:07:36.240 more from the school's kindergarten
00:07:39.680 usually in schools you find
00:07:41.599 kindergartens
00:07:42.800 they play and they sleep all day when i
00:07:45.759 got here
00:07:47.039 kindergartens were taking naps for maybe
00:07:49.520 two or three hours a day
00:07:51.039 and the first thing that i said get them
00:07:52.720 up please and have them learning
00:07:54.960 and you teach them
00:07:56.670 
00:07:58.800 is the last word i shall
00:08:02.160 ever write stop for a second at highly
00:08:05.360 successful schools the leaders demand
00:08:07.280 that students achieve
00:08:09.120 nancy ishinaga of bennett q makes her
00:08:11.599 expectations clear
00:08:13.039 to both students and parents okay
00:08:16.160 i see two problems number one you know
00:08:18.000 math okay number one you got to learn
00:08:19.840 your fractions
00:08:22.319 and i'm going to talk to your mom so she
00:08:23.680 can go to drugstore and buy you a
00:08:25.599 workbook on fractions and you can work
00:08:27.520 on it
00:08:28.319 and i'll teach you how to teach you okay
00:08:31.440 in other words we have expectations by
00:08:33.760 grade level for every kid
00:08:35.760 and the kids know from the very very
00:08:38.000 beginning
00:08:38.799 that if they are in kindergarten these
00:08:41.599 are the things
00:08:42.559 they have to master before the year is
00:08:44.399 over and if they don't they probably
00:08:46.720 will not go on to the next grade
00:08:49.519 and our kids understand this and parents
00:08:52.880 understand this
00:08:54.000 very well well that's good and it would
00:08:57.120 help because your son is in exactly the
00:08:59.120 same boat
00:09:00.320 you know he can add divide and he can
00:09:03.440 even multiply
00:09:05.120 but he has not been taught fractions
00:09:08.240 you're going to do some work with me
00:09:09.440 this morning right michael pat sander
00:09:11.839 is another leader who creates school
00:09:13.600 policies that help realize her high
00:09:15.760 expectations
00:09:18.640 at alki elementary her approach is to
00:09:21.279 teach as though
00:09:22.080 every child were gifted at al-qaeda what
00:09:24.880 we've tried to do is
00:09:26.640 no longer remediate children but
00:09:28.640 accelerate them
00:09:30.000 we believe that the kinds of education
00:09:32.880 that people have
00:09:34.160 supported for gifted children over the
00:09:36.480 last five or ten years
00:09:38.480 are the kinds of instructional
00:09:39.839 approaches and the kinds of education
00:09:41.440 that all children should have
00:09:43.279 this smart cornmeal right good question
00:09:46.800 linda and linda look up here
00:09:49.120 like pat sander principal gary tubbs at
00:09:51.519 beacon hill
00:09:52.320 expects excellence from his students and
00:09:54.959 tubbs applies the same standard to his
00:09:57.120 teachers too
00:09:58.720 i have no tolerance for a teacher that
00:10:03.440 tends to give up on a child because i
00:10:05.920 don't believe it
00:10:06.720 i've never seen a child this is my 17th
00:10:08.800 year i've never seen a child
00:10:10.480 who can't learn and i've worked with
00:10:13.200 special education children i've worked
00:10:14.880 with
00:10:15.839 children of all poverty and affluent
00:10:18.480 levels
00:10:19.200 children from the worst thing just
00:10:21.680 incredibly
00:10:23.200 difficult histories in their family and
00:10:25.839 in their personal lives
00:10:27.040 those children can learn too we just
00:10:29.120 haven't in some cases
00:10:31.040 found the right combination to enable
00:10:33.440 them to learn
00:10:34.820 
00:10:41.440 yes some adults do paint like that but
00:10:43.920 we expect more from children
00:10:48.800 in this classroom at rice math teacher
00:10:51.360 victor washington
00:10:52.480 works with students to develop their
00:10:54.240 thinking and problem solving skills
00:10:57.279 rice students are known throughout the
00:10:59.120 district for their excellence in math
00:11:02.240 they are a major force at math olympiad
00:11:04.480 competitions
00:11:07.200 this is the substitution for it when you
00:11:09.279 come up with
00:11:11.279 a linear equation like that how would
00:11:13.440 you solve it what would i do first
00:11:17.440 you multiply then you do what
00:11:21.040 multiply and then do what work from left
00:11:23.360 to right thank you
00:11:24.560 not just add you multiply first then you
00:11:27.279 work from left
00:11:28.560 to right okay so i would do two times
00:11:30.880 three years
00:11:32.240 i expect them to learn math they don't
00:11:33.839 have any other choice it's mandatory
00:11:35.519 they're there
00:11:36.160 and they can do it i know that a lot of
00:11:38.000 people are afraid minorities as well as
00:11:40.399 other
00:11:41.519 students are afraid of math they run
00:11:44.240 away from that
00:11:45.360 but here i if you're in my room i expect
00:11:47.920 you to learn
00:11:48.800 i'll help you any way possible if you
00:11:50.800 want my help
00:11:52.240 but i expect you to do it and you have
00:11:54.079 no other choice
00:11:56.240 what if i make a long line like that
00:11:57.680 would that work
00:11:59.680 you don't like that all right thank you
00:12:02.240 i need the positive reinforcement all
00:12:03.839 right who can raise the hand tim what
00:12:05.279 will go inside our um the name of the
00:12:06.800 shape is what everyone
00:12:08.959 what would go inside the heptagon and
00:12:10.800 i'll give you
00:12:12.639 15 seconds to figure it out and i'll
00:12:14.480 take ideas one
00:12:16.880 two three rice's dedication to
00:12:19.760 excellence in math is enhanced by its
00:12:21.760 involvement in project
00:12:23.120 seed seed is an intensive class for
00:12:26.320 all rice math students in grades four
00:12:28.639 through six
00:12:30.560 but this isn't just about math it's
00:12:32.720 about building a positive self-concept
00:12:35.600 if you had to answer five to the power 3
00:12:37.519 you couldn't put if and only 5 to the
00:12:38.959 power of 3 equals 125.
00:12:40.800 we use mathematics as a tool and the two
00:12:44.160 is to raise the self-confidence and
00:12:47.040 self-esteem
00:12:47.920 you can raise their self-esteem by
00:12:50.079 teaching how to play
00:12:51.279 chess but when you teach them how to the
00:12:54.480 mathematics and
00:12:55.760 and get them excited about their
00:12:57.200 learning education
00:12:58.880 because education is the key for a lot
00:13:01.360 of these kids
00:13:02.480 to be successful if we get them excited
00:13:04.639 about learning
00:13:06.320 and believing in themselves that they
00:13:08.720 can do anything that they want to do
00:13:10.959 as long as they try and give it their
00:13:13.920 all
00:13:14.480 then that's that's what we are for
00:13:16.240 unless everyone let's read it follow my
00:13:18.839 finger
00:13:25.279 glee's high expectations for his math
00:13:27.200 students are being realized
00:13:29.360 these students are doing work many grade
00:13:31.680 levels above their actual standing in
00:13:34.000 many occasions
00:13:35.200 i've actually come into the classroom
00:13:37.440 and brought my calculus text
00:13:39.360 and said pique one of those problems out
00:13:41.279 there and they would pick it
00:13:43.279 and then when they solved they said man
00:13:45.040 we solved a problem
00:13:46.639 from a college algebra book and they get
00:13:49.440 so excited
00:13:51.360 and so that that right there just boosts
00:13:53.519 their their self-image and their
00:13:54.959 self-confidence that hey
00:13:56.320 if i can do this i can do anything on
00:13:58.560 sixth grade level or seventh or eighth
00:14:00.160 grade level
00:14:00.880 and who could tell me in 92 what number
00:14:03.040 is in the tens place
00:14:04.639 and the team's place on 92. all right
00:14:06.720 show me your fingers what number that
00:14:08.079 would be
00:14:09.040 and say that number on two one two
00:14:12.959 and raise your hand you can tell me what
00:14:14.160 nine times five is nine times five say
00:14:16.560 it everyone
00:14:17.120 william glee has felt the sting of low
00:14:19.279 expectations himself
00:14:21.279 despite good grades his high school
00:14:23.199 counselor suggested that he wasn't
00:14:24.959 college material
00:14:26.480 so i was told that and i believed in
00:14:28.959 myself and said well
00:14:30.399 i'm not going that route i'm going to
00:14:32.240 college so i said
00:14:33.839 if i was told that then some of these
00:14:35.839 kids are being told that not only
00:14:37.839 by time to get to high school they're
00:14:39.440 being told that third grade
00:14:41.920 fourth grade fifth grade by the time
00:14:44.000 they get to the seventh eighth grade
00:14:45.279 they're starting to believe what they
00:14:46.560 hear
00:14:47.120 they don't believe in themselves so
00:14:50.399 so i believe in and i have confidence
00:14:52.480 and every single kid
00:14:54.959 can learn if they're motivated
00:14:59.839 name the elements i think i can i think
00:15:03.440 i can
00:15:04.270 
00:15:09.199 on a seattle beach these first graders
00:15:11.760 from alki
00:15:12.639 school are getting some hands-on
00:15:14.560 learning today the teachers hope the
00:15:16.720 experience will motivate kids to learn
00:15:18.800 more about sea life
00:15:20.000 if you look on the back here if it's
00:15:21.760 long and narrow there that means it's a
00:15:23.680 male
00:15:24.320 if this patch right here is big and
00:15:26.560 round
00:15:27.839 then it's a female dead crab i did crab
00:15:31.279 i wonder what
00:15:32.560 this one is
00:15:40.160 a way to bring real life experience so
00:15:43.360 that the child
00:15:44.720 can then take that information back and
00:15:48.160 write about things they become totally
00:15:51.440 engrossed in what it is that they're
00:15:53.040 doing
00:15:54.000 and the motivation is there that the
00:15:57.040 feeling that
00:15:58.000 god we want to learn all we can about it
00:16:00.560 and
00:16:01.440 it just seems to create
00:16:04.720 a feeling in them that they they can do
00:16:07.519 it and they want to do it and it has
00:16:09.759 meaning to them and i think that's the
00:16:11.440 whole
00:16:12.079 point of what we're doing for kids
00:16:16.560 later in the week the same students will
00:16:18.480 put together their own books about the
00:16:20.160 field trip
00:16:21.279 they'll write poetry create math story
00:16:23.759 problems around sea life
00:16:25.440 and do art projects about the creatures
00:16:27.440 they saw
00:16:30.399 and it's usually pretty in another alki
00:16:33.120 classroom
00:16:33.759 colleen dumas works to integrate the
00:16:35.759 curriculum and
00:16:36.880 improve her students critical thinking
00:16:38.560 skills
00:16:39.920 in an activity called private eye the
00:16:42.639 students look at common objects through
00:16:44.639 a jeweler's loop
00:16:45.920 and draw what they see then they make
00:16:48.320 analogies
00:16:49.199 based on their drawings i think i did a
00:16:51.600 silver dollar
00:16:52.800 and it reminded me of an eyeball
00:16:56.959 definitely a
00:17:00.160 geography map so this is a butterfly and
00:17:03.440 she writes
00:17:04.000 that it reminds her of a geography map
00:17:07.520 great thinking later the students will
00:17:10.319 explore the analogies
00:17:11.599 even further in their writing analogies
00:17:15.039 showing relationship is an important
00:17:17.599 skill
00:17:18.160 i'm finding that the analogies and their
00:17:20.640 ability to see relationship
00:17:22.720 transfers it transfers into their
00:17:25.760 science into their
00:17:27.199 social studies it integrates the
00:17:29.360 curriculum
00:17:30.840 more i think it's a great program
00:17:35.120 high expectations you've seen how
00:17:38.000 students can rise to them
00:17:40.000 the schools that we visited created
00:17:41.919 supportive learning environments
00:17:44.160 set rigorous academic standards and
00:17:46.640 developed instruction that promotes high
00:17:48.720 order thinking skills
00:17:50.640 these schools set high expectations and
00:17:53.760 found ways to help students meet them
00:17:56.559 there's a tendency for educators to say
00:17:58.880 i can't teach this child
00:18:00.080 when they come from this kind of home i
00:18:01.919 can't teach this child when they don't
00:18:03.520 come
00:18:03.919 with any breakfast we can't teach this
00:18:06.799 child they're just too disruptive
00:18:08.880 and so the finger pointing is that the
00:18:10.720 family or the finger pointing's at
00:18:12.160 society or the finger finger-pointing's
00:18:13.600 at the teacher next door or
00:18:15.280 or at the principal and the the concept
00:18:18.080 or the philosophy in this school was
00:18:19.600 let's get past that
00:18:21.120 that that doesn't no good that we need
00:18:24.000 to maybe bend our finger around to
00:18:25.520 ourselves
00:18:26.160 each of us to ourselves and say how are
00:18:27.919 we accountable and
00:18:29.440 do we believe that we as a team can
00:18:32.240 truly make a difference
00:18:33.360 in the lives of all the children



00:19:02.590 
00:19:07.120 what we're really used to looking at is
00:19:08.960 that traditional pta where everybody
00:19:11.120 comes once a month and
00:19:12.720 you kind of have tea and cookies and you
00:19:14.320 discuss the pta budget
00:19:15.919 and that may not be what parents are
00:19:18.400 interested in this particular community
00:19:20.240 i mean parents may be interested in
00:19:21.919 just those things that affect their
00:19:23.679 child so you almost have to begin to
00:19:25.840 kind of rethink ptas and those kind of
00:19:27.840 organizations i mean what are they here
00:19:30.290 
00:19:36.840 for
00:19:51.200 help parents anticipate what school
00:19:53.280 might parental involvement can be a
00:19:55.120 potent force in helping to improve
00:19:56.880 schools
00:19:58.080 in the highly effective schools we
00:19:59.679 visited parents do play an
00:20:01.520 active role in their children's
00:20:03.039 education
00:20:04.559 that means it's a male if this patch
00:20:06.960 right here
00:20:07.600 it's big and round then it's a female
00:20:11.440 we found that relevant parental
00:20:13.200 involvement the kind that has a direct
00:20:15.200 positive impact on learning
00:20:17.039 can take many different forms we'll look
00:20:19.520 at four of them
00:20:22.280 
00:20:26.799 hey it's just a report on my progress
00:20:29.679 not an indictment of my upbringing
00:20:35.440 at the van school in pittsburgh most of
00:20:37.440 the students come from single parent
00:20:39.120 families
00:20:40.320 principal doris brevard knows the
00:20:42.080 pressures on the parents
00:20:43.440 in her community and that's not true
00:20:46.799 especially in this area where you have
00:20:49.039 parents
00:20:49.840 that are just trying to survive and that
00:20:52.720 takes all of their energy and their time
00:20:55.520 but all i ask is the parent have a
00:20:58.080 positive approach
00:20:59.520 to the school that the parent sends
00:21:01.840 their child to school with a positive
00:21:03.919 attitude
00:21:05.280 that the parent feels a part of the
00:21:07.039 school they know they can come to us if
00:21:09.440 they have a problem they can discuss it
00:21:11.280 with us
00:21:12.240 if they need help in rearing their child
00:21:14.960 helping their child with their homework
00:21:16.559 etc
00:21:18.640 that they can come here for assistance
00:21:21.840 you don't want to send them on not
00:21:23.520 prepared right that's going to be
00:21:25.360 disastrous
00:21:27.600 if we need them and call them we want
00:21:30.880 them to come but we don't expect to see
00:21:32.880 them
00:21:33.520 every day volunteering their time
00:21:36.880 that's not necessary by getting kids to
00:21:40.640 school on time with a positive attitude
00:21:42.720 toward learning parents support the
00:21:44.960 day-to-day activities of the school
00:21:47.600 another way they can help is to keep
00:21:49.039 track of their child's progress
00:21:53.120 at seattle's beacon hill school
00:21:55.200 principal gary tubbs also faces a parent
00:21:57.600 community
00:21:58.400 with precious little time for
00:22:00.080 traditional parent involvement
00:22:02.240 he instituted a folder system to help
00:22:04.480 parents monitor their children's
00:22:06.000 progress
00:22:07.440 we give homework and we believe that
00:22:09.360 everybody should be held accountable for
00:22:10.799 completing that and returning
00:22:12.080 it to school then once a week flyers
00:22:15.200 newsletters notes all sorts of things
00:22:17.760 will go in this folder and then these
00:22:19.200 will go home just once a week
00:22:20.880 and again the parents and the students
00:22:22.960 are responsible for making sure that the
00:22:24.480 parent signs here
00:22:26.080 and then that's returned to the teacher
00:22:28.000 and the teacher knows that the materials
00:22:29.679 got home to the parent
00:22:32.000 that keeps our communication lines open
00:22:33.919 it also involves the parents in a
00:22:35.440 meaningful way in the
00:22:36.720 education of the children
00:22:42.320 he doesn't listen to a thing we say he's
00:22:44.799 very noisy and he's
00:22:46.159 always getting into trouble i think he's
00:22:48.880 ready to start school
00:22:52.880 educators agree learning can only take
00:22:55.679 place in a safe
00:22:56.799 secure environment and in order to have
00:22:59.360 one
00:22:59.919 discipline is essential parents can play
00:23:02.480 a major role in supporting school
00:23:04.240 discipline
00:23:05.840 at the euclid school in los angeles
00:23:08.159 principal esther mcshane
00:23:09.600 first works on discipline with the
00:23:11.200 individual child
00:23:13.120 when you get angry at somebody mark what
00:23:15.039 do you need to do
00:23:17.120 tell the teacher that if i can go to
00:23:18.720 your office okay now first of all let's
00:23:20.799 talk about something do you have a right
00:23:22.400 to get angry
00:23:23.360 yes yes what do you need to do with the
00:23:25.679 person if you're angry with the person
00:23:27.919 i need to help the child understand
00:23:31.039 their particular emotion at that time
00:23:34.240 where there was a violation of another
00:23:36.240 human being
00:23:37.520 are you are you free to leave the class
00:23:39.360 to come and see me oh yeah
00:23:40.640 to come tell the teacher if i can go
00:23:44.080 and if i'm not in the room yeah i can
00:23:46.480 wait okay
00:23:47.679 you could shoot some baskets in the
00:23:49.760 office
00:23:50.799 okay and so so this threatening
00:23:55.279 teasing are no longer options for you
00:23:58.559 okay okay
00:24:01.600 my philosophy and the discipline of the
00:24:03.520 child if the child comes to my office on
00:24:05.840 the third time
00:24:06.960 it's mandatory parent
00:24:10.159 involvement we make we make a session
00:24:13.200 we meet together i don't talk about the
00:24:16.320 problem
00:24:17.039 the child talks about the problem
00:24:25.279 okay frank you're ready to return to
00:24:27.279 school that correct
00:24:28.320 yes okay that's listed
00:24:37.760 the most important thing to you is what
00:24:40.960 have you learned from your mistake
00:24:43.760 parents need to know that we're here for
00:24:45.679 them we're here to support
00:24:48.159 the child and to support their role
00:24:52.690 
00:24:56.400 dad parents day was yesterday it's my
00:24:59.520 turn now
00:25:01.919 you can really understand if you're
00:25:03.360 working with a child in reading what is
00:25:04.960 it that you could do to enhance
00:25:06.559 what the teacher is doing within that
00:25:08.000 classroom
00:25:09.600 when parents do have time they can
00:25:11.760 contribute to instruction
00:25:13.200 in the school at the new suncook school
00:25:16.000 in rural maine
00:25:17.279 principal gary mcdonald knows that
00:25:18.960 parents can make a difference
00:25:21.120 i can't express the fact that we really
00:25:24.640 want to get parents
00:25:26.000 continued our parents involved in the
00:25:27.760 children's learnings
00:25:29.200 parents to me and to the entire staff
00:25:31.760 here are seen as being
00:25:33.200 tremendous value they're welcome at all
00:25:35.440 times and they're
00:25:37.120 a we try to provide them with the
00:25:40.320 with the knowledge and the opportunities
00:25:42.480 that they can really feel an integral
00:25:44.400 part of the building
00:25:45.440 i mean right from the very beginning we
00:25:47.279 were welcomed in before christian
00:25:48.880 started kindergarten
00:25:49.919 and very open policy we want you to be a
00:25:52.400 part of what's happening really a
00:25:53.760 partnership
00:25:54.960 happening here and that was wonderful
00:25:56.960 for us
00:26:00.960 valerie wilfong is one of the many
00:26:03.120 parents who help at new suncook
00:26:05.919 i've worked in schools before i had
00:26:07.679 children i volunteered in classrooms
00:26:09.760 where teachers were not used to having
00:26:12.240 volunteers or other people and they kind
00:26:14.159 of felt kind of nervous but all of these
00:26:15.840 teachers are set up to
00:26:17.279 to feel real comfortable about other
00:26:18.720 people in their classroom they're not
00:26:19.919 threatened by them
00:26:20.960 it's great for parents for one thing to
00:26:22.960 be able to be part of what's happening
00:26:24.799 and see what's happening in the
00:26:26.000 classroom and it's it's great where all
00:26:28.080 the children are working at their own
00:26:30.000 pace to be able to have an extra pair of
00:26:32.000 hands
00:26:32.480 to listen to to one group all the
00:26:34.880 teachers working more intensively with
00:26:36.320 someone else
00:26:37.440 so i think it is a great great benefit
00:26:40.559 for everybody
00:26:42.880 i have several parent volunteers and i
00:26:44.799 really depend on them when they're here
00:26:46.240 because they just
00:26:47.200 it's like an extra hand and they really
00:26:49.039 want to know what's going on in the
00:26:50.159 school and it's great to have them here
00:26:51.760 to be able to for their help but also
00:26:53.520 for their
00:26:54.240 enthusiasm support they can lend to the
00:26:56.240 school so
00:26:57.360 they're not in the way at all everyone
00:27:00.559 knows me you come down the hall at the
00:27:02.080 end of the day and hi mrs so fun with
00:27:03.679 what i did in school today and
00:27:05.200 it's it's a great kind of feeling
00:27:08.480 at the bennett q school just outside los
00:27:10.640 angeles principal nancy ishinaga expects
00:27:13.520 parents to help their children
00:27:15.120 master certain skills at specific grade
00:27:17.679 levels
00:27:18.640 here she talks with the parent of two
00:27:20.399 new students i think about
00:27:22.320 a 3.6
00:27:25.520 okay now in math she's right she's just
00:27:28.559 about six months behind and let me show
00:27:30.399 you
00:27:30.960 what she's missing i had a fourth and
00:27:32.640 fifth grader who came
00:27:34.000 in from a school in los angeles
00:27:38.240 i checked them on their writing on the
00:27:40.080 reading and their math
00:27:41.279 and i found out that both of them were a
00:27:44.240 little bit below grade level
00:27:46.159 now the parent said well you know at the
00:27:47.840 other school my daughter was an a
00:27:49.600 student was an
00:27:50.399 honor roll and was doing very well and i
00:27:53.679 said yeah i think she
00:27:54.799 she's very bright but there's some
00:27:56.720 skills that she hasn't been taught
00:27:59.039 our kids have already had fractions
00:28:01.200 because we do that in the first half of
00:28:02.799 the year
00:28:03.360 in the fourth grade so my suggestion to
00:28:05.919 you is
00:28:06.799 is to go to the drugstore and look for
00:28:09.520 workbooks on simple fraction
00:28:11.760 and help her with that oh i know that
00:28:13.840 good
00:28:15.600 well that's good and it would help
00:28:17.840 because generally
00:28:18.880 they understand parents understand kids
00:28:22.159 have to
00:28:22.720 attain certain skill levels that's not
00:28:25.120 new
00:28:25.760 in fact many of them say it's about time
00:28:28.320 there's a school
00:28:29.279 that requires certain kinds of learning
00:28:31.039 before the kids are promoted
00:28:32.399 in my other school they just passed them
00:28:34.159 on so we don't do that
00:28:37.039 he can add divide asking and expecting a
00:28:40.559 parent to give a child some help in
00:28:42.240 learning
00:28:43.120 is one way to increase parental
00:28:44.720 involvement he's forgotten it
00:28:52.159 of course the traditional fundraising
00:28:54.000 functions of parent groups
00:28:55.440 have long served to enrich the academic
00:28:57.520 experience for students
00:28:59.600 these bingo players are helping to raise
00:29:01.520 money for the students of the
00:29:02.799 thorncliffe school
00:29:03.919 in edmonton canada
00:29:11.120 these students from euclid school in los
00:29:12.960 angeles are on a field trip
00:29:14.559 in valley forge pennsylvania with money
00:29:17.039 raised partly by parent groups
00:29:26.680 
00:29:33.120 and at the charles rice school in dallas
00:29:35.679 the choir prepares to perform on a road
00:29:38.000 trip
00:29:38.320 funded by parents we've been
00:29:41.520 active in a lot of trips out of town
00:29:44.320 we've got parents
00:29:45.279 booster clubs who support the choir or
00:29:48.080 the choir's doing an east coast
00:29:49.600 tour this spring you know and and people
00:29:52.480 outside this community would say well
00:29:54.159 how are you going to do that
00:29:55.360 how the world are those parents going to
00:29:56.640 afford to send their kids on an east
00:29:58.799 coast tour
00:30:00.320 parents do it because they know that
00:30:01.919 it's important for kids and i think we
00:30:03.760 can never underestimate what our parents
00:30:05.600 will do
00:30:06.240 when their kids lives are at stake
00:30:23.220 
00:30:26.960 so uh tell me how do you like the parent
00:30:29.200 council's new idea for checking
00:30:30.720 attendance
00:30:34.559 at the alki school in seattle parents
00:30:36.960 are involved in all the ways we've
00:30:38.559 talked about
00:30:39.440 and in one other school management and
00:30:43.360 we've got the capability to do it i
00:30:45.440 think the translation i don't know about
00:30:46.880 the translation issue how do you
00:30:49.120 my thought would be to uh talk with art
00:30:51.919 cono
00:30:52.559 down in the main office at aokai a site
00:30:54.399 management council
00:30:55.600 similar to a board of directors makes
00:30:57.760 important policy decisions concerning
00:30:59.679 the school
00:31:00.880 the council includes the principal staff
00:31:03.039 members and
00:31:04.000 four parents one of those parents bill
00:31:06.640 stahlser
00:31:07.440 is the chairman well another
00:31:09.519 recommendation why i do it is there is
00:31:11.440 more than one perspective
00:31:13.440 when you're talking about the education
00:31:14.799 of kids and the and and the one
00:31:16.960 perspective we have
00:31:18.240 i think even if parents we've abdicated
00:31:20.559 is there is say okay well teachers you
00:31:22.559 do it okay
00:31:23.600 the principle of teachers here here's my
00:31:25.279 kid you know you teach them and and
00:31:27.279 and and i'll go away uh or except to
00:31:29.760 complain maybe about you know you're not
00:31:31.200 doing enough
00:31:32.960 and so this says now wait a second that
00:31:35.360 the parents
00:31:36.399 perspective and the perspective of
00:31:38.399 somebody in a in in a business in this
00:31:40.159 community
00:31:40.960 in this neighborhood they all
00:31:44.399 have a perspective that affects
00:31:46.640 education of kids and should be taken
00:31:48.240 into account
00:31:49.200 all the styles there
00:31:53.279 louise mckinney is also interested in
00:31:55.200 the site council and its efforts to
00:31:57.200 improve student achievement all of it
00:32:00.640 is focused to the end that children will
00:32:04.159 learn and
00:32:04.799 anytime you're doing something and you
00:32:06.399 can't see the connection between
00:32:08.480 it and achievement for youngsters that's
00:32:11.120 something that you discard
00:32:12.960 different faculty groups different
00:32:15.440 parent groups
00:32:16.399 have different reasons for starting site
00:32:18.320 councils some schools look at it as
00:32:20.640 that's the way to get rid of teachers
00:32:22.480 or that's the way to get rid of the
00:32:23.919 principal and if that's
00:32:26.159 the reason why a site council is
00:32:28.080 established
00:32:30.159 then that's the wrong reason information
00:32:34.000 from the staff's point of view though we
00:32:35.519 would want instruction
00:32:37.120 uh and maybe the september bonding
00:32:39.760 homeroom time could be useful it's much
00:32:41.760 more
00:32:42.320 uh i guess in a in a supportive role
00:32:45.440 saying okay can i help marshall the
00:32:47.360 resources and second to evaluate from an
00:32:49.679 outsider's point of view
00:32:50.880 how's the school doing well how are kids
00:32:53.120 doing academically
00:32:54.320 how's the principal doing okay and not
00:32:56.880 sort of any hostile way but say you know
00:32:58.559 we need to ask ourselves how are we
00:33:00.159 doing
00:33:02.559 mundy bulletin we sent one home in
00:33:05.120 english one home with a translation
00:33:07.360 is it helpful to do both i mean do you
00:33:09.039 think we should also send one home in
00:33:10.640 english
00:33:11.279 so that if there's someone that could
00:33:12.880 tran you know could read it in english
00:33:14.480 whereas maybe
00:33:16.799 another site council member is knee hall
00:33:19.279 a native of cambodia who came to america
00:33:21.600 in 1975.
00:33:23.279 we are raised in a very poor country we
00:33:26.159 didn't have that good opportunity like
00:33:27.919 this country
00:33:29.120 so when we are here in this country have
00:33:31.760 plenty of opportunity
00:33:33.039 why not take it so because of that
00:33:35.519 commitment
00:33:36.159 i would like to see our refugees kid
00:33:38.799 grow the way it is supposed to be
00:33:41.039 that's what my my my commitment to be
00:33:44.080 part of this
00:33:44.720 site council i think this school here
00:33:47.039 look like a
00:33:47.760 parent and a teacher a partner
00:33:51.279 and work together it's very important
00:33:53.679 that all of us must work together
00:33:56.000 we open mind and try to understand each
00:33:58.000 other so when i
00:34:00.240 involve in this one not just only psych
00:34:02.480 counsel i try to
00:34:04.080 someone as well you know telling them
00:34:06.080 about my culture
00:34:07.279 and all the people culture so then we
00:34:09.440 can try to understand each other and can
00:34:11.280 work well together
00:34:13.679 not one of us can do it alone the
00:34:15.280 parents know certainly the most about
00:34:17.119 their children
00:34:18.159 they know more than we do and they have
00:34:20.239 a different perspective on what's
00:34:21.679 beneficial for
00:34:22.879 their kids the staff brings that
00:34:25.359 educational
00:34:26.960 background and professional experience
00:34:29.359 and
00:34:30.000 hopefully i bring the administrative
00:34:31.918 background that that can maybe pull it
00:34:33.918 all together
00:34:38.320 understanding each other and working
00:34:40.239 well together
00:34:41.679 when teachers principals and parents can
00:34:43.760 do these things
00:34:44.960 schools prosper parental
00:34:48.000 involvement helps the four kinds of
00:34:50.480 involvement we've looked at can make a
00:34:52.320 major difference
00:34:53.359 in student learning and success whether
00:34:56.239 it's supporting day-to-day activities by
00:34:58.320 getting kids to school on time
00:35:00.079 ready to learn or keeping track of
00:35:02.880 student progress and homework completion
00:35:05.680 supporting the teacher when it comes to
00:35:07.280 discipline
00:35:08.800 volunteering time to help in the
00:35:10.400 instructional program itself
00:35:12.560 or even to help manage the school it all
00:35:15.520 helps
00:35:18.000 no one person or group of people
00:35:21.760 is responsible for the education
00:35:25.280 of our children we believe in parents
00:35:27.920 specifically
00:35:29.040 being involved we believe in teachers
00:35:31.760 coming together with those that
00:35:33.119 community
00:35:33.839 and those parents to make sure
00:35:37.200 that everybody understands what the
00:35:39.680 process is
00:35:40.960 everybody understands what the vision is
00:35:43.520 and everybody
00:35:45.920 is able to find his or her place in that
00:35:49.280 process
00:35:50.160 toward the implementation of that vision



00:36:19.190 
00:36:25.280 what is a successful school like
00:36:28.960 is it noisy is it quiet
00:36:33.920 is it traditionally organized or is it
00:36:37.119 more
00:36:37.440 experimental you can't always tell by
00:36:40.320 looking
00:36:41.200 each successful school is unique it is
00:36:44.240 shaped by its mission
00:36:45.760 a set of beliefs shared by everyone at
00:36:47.920 the school
00:36:49.040 beliefs that guide the way to success
00:36:55.610 
00:37:14.560 each successful school we visited was
00:37:16.640 once a troubled school with poor test
00:37:18.800 scores and low staff morale
00:37:21.200 each school turned things around how
00:37:24.160 they
00:37:24.480 created and then implemented a mission
00:37:27.200 focused on
00:37:27.920 improving achievement for every child a
00:37:30.880 school should be
00:37:32.079 a place where kids come to learn we
00:37:35.200 believe that it is our job to educate
00:37:37.760 the kids to make them literate
00:37:40.240 it's not the home's job it's our job
00:37:43.520 we feel that here at new suncook that
00:37:46.079 all kids can be successful
00:37:47.680 we feel that we it's our
00:37:51.440 responsibility to create environments so
00:37:53.680 that we try to maximize
00:37:55.599 for every child their potential i firmly
00:37:57.839 believe that all children can learn
00:38:00.720 i think that uh hank levin says that
00:38:03.119 parents send us the best children
00:38:04.640 they've got
00:38:05.359 and they in fact do and i think that
00:38:10.800 every child has a strength and what we
00:38:12.560 have to do is find that strength
00:38:14.640 all of the folks here share a common
00:38:17.119 vision
00:38:18.000 they have a very similar philosophy
00:38:21.040 and that's every one of them will teach
00:38:23.040 and every child in this building is
00:38:24.400 going to learn
00:38:25.200 each one of you can help the other
00:38:35.040 hello i'm billy bernard part of the mess
00:38:37.599 you inherited from the previous
00:38:39.119 administration
00:38:40.020 
00:38:42.880 when pat sander became principal of alki
00:38:45.280 school in seattle
00:38:46.560 she was confronted by a staff and
00:38:48.480 parents who lacked a common vision of
00:38:50.720 what the school should be
00:38:54.560 basically it was a school that staff
00:38:57.760 didn't talk to one another
00:38:59.680 they were isolates within their own
00:39:02.800 classrooms and the staff
00:39:06.640 thought that the parents ran the
00:39:07.920 building the parents thought
00:39:09.920 the staff ran the building so there was
00:39:12.880 no communication between
00:39:14.079 parents and staff and uh there was just
00:39:17.520 a real power struggle going on even
00:39:19.200 amongst staff
00:39:20.079 as to who was going to be in charge
00:39:22.720 right you okay
00:39:24.400 what happened
00:39:30.720 whoa you sure did didn't you sweetheart
00:39:33.119 at the end of pat sanders first month on
00:39:35.280 the job
00:39:35.920 a newspaper reported that alki was one
00:39:38.320 of the 20 worst schools in the city
00:39:41.760 well probably the best thing that
00:39:43.119 happened for me was that the scores had
00:39:45.040 been falling and the newspaper article
00:39:47.200 came
00:39:47.520 out because it gave
00:39:50.560 the parents the staff and myself a place
00:39:52.800 to rally around that was an objective
00:39:54.960 place
00:39:55.599 that we needed to make a difference and
00:39:57.119 do something different for children
00:39:59.280 out of this experience came the
00:40:00.960 beginnings of a shared
00:40:02.480 mission parents and the alki staff
00:40:05.680 began working together to improve
00:40:07.680 student achievement
00:40:15.680 across the bay from alki is seattle's
00:40:18.480 beacon hill school
00:40:21.119 here the school's mission has become a
00:40:23.119 living document
00:40:25.280 it's as vital to beacon hill as a
00:40:27.520 constitution is to a country
00:40:32.400 principal gary tubbs and his staff wrote
00:40:34.800 the school's mission together
00:40:37.040 so this is a way of clarifying and
00:40:39.359 putting down making a
00:40:40.960 a snapshot picture of where we see
00:40:43.520 ourselves where we'd see
00:40:44.800 like us to go and trying to celebrate
00:40:47.119 the success
00:40:48.720 beacon hills mission is to develop their
00:40:51.280 students
00:40:51.839 into responsible literate adults that's
00:40:54.800 easy to say
00:40:55.839 but gary tubbs knows the hard part is
00:40:58.319 making his school's vision
00:41:00.079 a practical reality that of course
00:41:03.839 is a vision that needs to be
00:41:07.040 constantly addressed and revisited and
00:41:10.079 be kept alive in our heads but also
00:41:12.880 brought down to
00:41:13.760 practical down to earth terms on how
00:41:15.839 does that look in the classroom
00:41:18.160 how does that turn into instruction how
00:41:21.040 does that turn into
00:41:22.160 curriculum how does we make learning
00:41:24.079 meaningful so that
00:41:25.359 it actually gets children a step closer
00:41:27.839 to that vision
00:41:35.200 i'm your teacher mrs gridley learn to
00:41:38.079 read
00:41:38.640 write and do arithmetic and nobody will
00:41:41.200 get hurt
00:41:42.150 
00:41:43.839 once a school has created a mission next
00:41:46.560 comes the day-by-day efforts to
00:41:48.560 implement that mission so you can be
00:41:51.040 aware
00:41:51.680 of what they went on the filter oh oh i
00:41:54.560 didn't come in
00:41:55.599 okay when esther mcshane became
00:41:58.319 principal at euclid avenue elementary
00:42:00.640 in los angeles it was the challenge of
00:42:03.119 her life
00:42:04.079 the school's environment was the worst
00:42:06.079 she had seen
00:42:07.359 professionally or academically it was a
00:42:10.079 school that
00:42:10.880 was almost a joke it was also a very
00:42:14.240 filthy school
00:42:16.160 there was no pride you know when you
00:42:18.160 look at it at a a situation where
00:42:20.560 there's no pride
00:42:21.680 you need to start there mcshane began to
00:42:24.720 implement the school's mission for
00:42:26.319 success by creating a more supportive
00:42:28.640 environment for teaching
00:42:30.000 and learning her actions showed the
00:42:32.240 staff and students
00:42:33.440 that their new principal cared about
00:42:35.200 them and if somebody
00:42:37.200 shows you that they truly care then
00:42:39.040 people begin to feel
00:42:40.319 they're important i'm important i can
00:42:43.280 live up to
00:42:44.160 whatever she thinks i'm capable of doing
00:42:47.599 of course a clean environment is only
00:42:49.760 the beginning
00:42:50.880 at many successful schools we visited
00:42:53.200 the disciplined policy
00:42:54.880 is also tied to the school's mission of
00:42:57.440 academic
00:42:58.079 success behavior comes first
00:43:01.760 in order for kids to learn they must
00:43:03.839 know how to behave in school
00:43:05.599 they must know how to come in school sit
00:43:08.800 listen to the teacher in order to learn
00:43:11.680 no
00:43:12.079 child can learn if they're talking when
00:43:14.319 the teacher is talking they miss out on
00:43:16.079 too much
00:43:17.520 at the van school in pittsburgh
00:43:19.440 principal doris brevard has implemented
00:43:21.839 a strict discipline policy for more than
00:43:24.000 20 years
00:43:25.440 she uses discipline to maximize the
00:43:28.000 amount of time her teachers have to
00:43:29.920 teach
00:43:30.720 the principal must provide the
00:43:32.720 atmosphere
00:43:33.760 and then it's the teacher's job to teach
00:43:37.119 but if that teacher can go into his or
00:43:39.839 her classroom
00:43:40.960 and teach 35 minutes of the 40-minute
00:43:44.079 period
00:43:45.040 then something will be accomplished but
00:43:47.599 the principal must see to it
00:43:49.520 that the discipline throughout the
00:43:51.119 building is such
00:43:52.560 that the teacher can teach the 35
00:43:55.119 minutes
00:43:55.839 and who did not get a turn i don't want
00:43:57.680 to skip anyone she
00:43:59.359 told me that she expects discipline
00:44:02.880 and that i'm here to teach and that
00:44:06.160 if there are any problems i just let her
00:44:08.160 know about them and she will handle them
00:44:09.760 and she's done that
00:44:10.640 she's just very supportive at van
00:44:14.160 it's every teacher's responsibility to
00:44:16.480 help implement the school's mission
00:44:18.800 doris brevard offers encouragement and
00:44:21.119 advice
00:44:22.000 but the teachers are on the front line
00:44:25.359 the same thing is true at new sun cook
00:44:27.200 school in level maine
00:44:28.720 where teachers work to turn the school's
00:44:30.640 mission into a practical reality
00:44:34.480 rhonda poliquin teaches fourth grade at
00:44:36.560 new suncook
00:44:37.760 she takes the school's mission to heart
00:44:39.520 when she plans class activities
00:44:42.720 we've worked towards kids becoming
00:44:44.079 independent learners so that you won't
00:44:46.000 see as much
00:44:47.680 a teacher standing in front of the class
00:44:49.119 and lecturing to kids because we want
00:44:50.800 kids to find out
00:44:52.000 how to get that information themselves
00:44:54.000 and if there's something they want to
00:44:55.040 find out about
00:44:56.079 giving them the tools and the skills
00:44:57.599 that they need to be able to find out
00:44:59.359 that information
00:45:01.119 just let's see what he does the way he
00:45:04.079 reacts i think it matters how much
00:45:06.000 like they're in the pupa stage like if
00:45:07.680 they're really white and short like this
00:45:09.440 one
00:45:10.000 yeah or if he's longer he's longer
00:45:14.560 yeah that one's longer that way no
00:45:19.119 see how big he is compared to this one
00:45:20.960 because that one's curling up
00:45:22.319 yeah this one looks fat yeah they get
00:45:24.400 fatter and his
00:45:25.520 his arm is still out it's not across his
00:45:27.839 chest yet
00:45:29.599 right yep
00:45:32.380 
00:45:34.160 at the successful schools we visited the
00:45:36.400 school's mission is implemented through
00:45:38.240 a carefully designed
00:45:39.599 instructional program nancy ishinaga
00:45:42.720 sees it as a three-step process number
00:45:45.599 one
00:45:46.480 is that we do believe that every child
00:45:50.000 can learn to read to write and to be a
00:45:52.160 successful student
00:45:53.760 and this belief is throughout the school
00:45:57.440 everybody believes that we just have to
00:45:59.359 figure out how
00:46:00.000 to do it and how to do it is the next
00:46:03.760 thing but you add you subtract you
00:46:06.720 multiply and you divide well
00:46:08.480 so we're going to let your teacher to
00:46:09.839 implement her mission nancy ashinaga
00:46:12.240 personally tests the academic skills of
00:46:14.400 each new student
00:46:15.920 and she meets with the child's parents
00:46:19.760 our kids have already had fractions
00:46:21.839 because we do that in the first half of
00:46:23.520 the year
00:46:24.079 in the fourth grade so my suggestion to
00:46:26.640 you is
00:46:27.520 is to go to the drugstore and look for
00:46:30.240 workbooks on simple fraction
00:46:32.480 and help her with that oh i know that
00:46:34.480 good objections
00:46:36.319 well that's good and he had already
00:46:39.760 a food he had some food does anyone
00:46:42.079 remember what food
00:46:43.280 then the students enter a sequenced and
00:46:45.280 rigorous academic program
00:46:47.520 nancy ashinaga visits each classroom
00:46:49.760 periodically
00:46:50.880 and meets with teachers to assess how
00:46:52.880 the students are doing
00:46:54.400 this is part two of her process and
00:46:57.440 maybe the third thing
00:46:58.640 is that we try to build an environment
00:47:02.079 in which uh everybody feels
00:47:06.160 that they are important and the fact
00:47:09.280 that what everybody does
00:47:11.040 contributes to the whole school so that
00:47:13.680 any school
00:47:16.160 which wants to succeed can do this it's
00:47:18.960 not a matter of personalities it's a
00:47:21.359 matter of having a system by which we
00:47:24.079 educate our kids
00:47:29.520 how do schools know if their mission of
00:47:31.359 academic success is being achieved
00:47:34.000 one technique we saw in use is constant
00:47:36.839 monitoring
00:47:44.079 doris brevard visits every class in her
00:47:46.400 school at least once a week
00:47:48.480 to find out what children are learning
00:47:52.079 oh what is it what is it principal
00:47:54.160 esther mcshane at euclid spends every
00:47:56.559 possible moment in the classrooms
00:47:59.040 on the playground we're just roving
00:48:01.280 through the corridors of her
00:48:05.280 the rent was school contract yes i got
00:48:07.280 his contract squared away i squared that
00:48:08.880 away
00:48:10.000 ruth johnson of the california
00:48:11.920 achievement council
00:48:13.119 believes that constant monitoring and
00:48:15.359 improvement
00:48:16.240 are two keys to success successful
00:48:19.359 schools i
00:48:20.079 also find they self-assess they don't
00:48:22.480 wait for an
00:48:23.200 outsider to come in and tell them how
00:48:25.599 well they're doing
00:48:26.800 they're constantly in a mode of
00:48:29.119 assessing
00:48:30.079 how are we doing what do we need to do
00:48:32.400 better there's
00:48:33.200 constant staff development there's peer
00:48:36.240 coaching going on
00:48:37.599 where teachers are looking at each other
00:48:40.400 and constantly trying to enhance
00:48:42.319 what they're doing in the classroom so
00:48:44.000 it's a constant mode of self
00:48:46.160 improvement going on all the time
00:48:50.079 so you feel like he's making a big deal
00:48:51.599 out of it
00:48:53.359 but you did push him at beacon hill
00:48:55.680 principal gary tubbs is also a strong
00:48:58.079 believer in monitoring
00:48:59.599 to assess how well his school is
00:49:01.200 achieving its mission
00:49:02.620 
00:49:04.480 none of it was your fault and when tub
00:49:06.559 sees that a student is having a problem
00:49:08.800 often it's time for a problem-solving
00:49:10.800 session
00:49:11.920 to talk a little bit about her the
00:49:14.079 interactions that children are having
00:49:15.760 with
00:49:16.000 her and what we can do jamie has to
00:49:19.359 really
00:49:20.160 be um the aggressor as
00:49:23.599 far as i would like to be your friend
00:49:25.200 i'd like to be your friend for a long
00:49:26.800 time and not just
00:49:27.920 one day and then go back into her old
00:49:30.800 role
00:49:31.280 of being so self-centered that she
00:49:33.680 doesn't want to open up to anyone
00:49:36.079 well she's probably afraid you know
00:49:38.319 she's been rejected for so long that
00:49:40.480 it's probably hard for her to
00:49:43.280 to even get real close to anyone okay
00:49:46.880 so what we have here is the fact that
00:49:49.200 this child
00:49:50.000 is feeling socially isolated there's a
00:49:52.640 number of reasons for that
00:49:54.079 that some we have control over some we
00:49:56.079 don't have control over
00:49:57.440 she has a lot of good qualities but she
00:49:59.280 does need help need
00:50:00.559 some social skills in developing
00:50:02.240 friendships and keeping friendships
00:50:03.920 because she is causing some of this
00:50:05.440 problem herself
00:50:06.960 then we need to we will have a class
00:50:10.240 meeting the counselor will conduct a
00:50:11.599 class
00:50:12.000 meeting we'll talk about friendship and
00:50:15.200 then work specifically
00:50:16.720 with jamie on getting friendships within
00:50:20.000 the classroom
00:50:20.960 so that at least for the remainder of
00:50:22.640 this year she has a sense of
00:50:24.480 of friendship
00:50:28.079 it's freddy's parents they want you to
00:50:30.319 tell them again
00:50:31.280 how gifted he is
00:50:41.119 another way for schools to reinforce
00:50:43.280 their mission and create a positive
00:50:45.119 culture and climate
00:50:46.559 is to publicly recognize those students
00:50:48.960 and teachers who succeed
00:50:50.480 stories last year that we had to send
00:50:53.680 him off to college
00:50:56.160 he went to college this summer to write
00:50:58.000 stories
00:50:59.200 to improve his behavior and his
00:51:01.680 achievement
00:51:02.640 whether it's for hard work improved
00:51:04.800 grades or behavior
00:51:06.160 good citizenship or good attendance
00:51:10.720 spirit day advan school is a celebration
00:51:13.359 of those students and teachers
00:51:15.040 who live the school's mission mrs digga
00:51:18.480 and her husband during the summer
00:51:21.280 developed the tremendous
00:51:23.599 computer program that we're using for
00:51:26.720 the first
00:51:27.359 grade would you please welcome mrs

00:52:55.760 out of the box
00:53:01.670 
00:53:07.760 every student feels they're a part of
00:53:09.680 the school's mission
00:53:11.920 the vision that we came to thorncliff
00:53:15.359 school with
00:53:16.559 was to make this the best school that it
00:53:19.200 can be
00:53:20.480 it is part of the heart and soul of the
00:53:23.359 school
00:53:24.000 that in a student-centered school the
00:53:26.559 belief
00:53:27.359 the generic belief is that every child
00:53:30.800 can succeed
00:53:34.000 in the schools we visited the turnaround
00:53:36.240 from failure to success began with a
00:53:38.400 clear mission
00:53:39.520 a vision shared by everyone at the
00:53:41.440 school
00:53:42.559 they implemented their vision with
00:53:44.160 discipline teacher involvement in
00:53:46.160 decision making
00:53:47.440 monitoring problem solving constant
00:53:50.160 improvement
00:53:51.280 and by recognizing both student and
00:53:53.760 teacher achievement the principal by
00:53:56.880 him or herself cannot orchestrate all
00:53:59.440 that unless they have the support of
00:54:01.200 their teachers
00:54:02.160 behind that whole vision and philosophy
00:54:04.480 and it's not just putting the vision
00:54:05.760 down on a piece of paper and saying now
00:54:07.280 we have a vision
00:54:08.240 it's truly believing in it and and truly
00:54:10.960 having it in your heart as well as in
00:54:12.880 your head
00:54:13.599 that you live it every day and it
00:54:15.359 becomes where all of your energy goes
00:54:17.359 you continually
00:54:18.720 work to channel a greater percentage of
00:54:20.880 your energy
00:54:22.000 into that vision
00:54:26.790 
00:54:45.680 you
