00:02:39.720 been watching chicks hatch from their
00:02:41.560 eggs in our incubator let's have a look
00:02:44.599 the egg is like a little house
00:02:46.640 protecting The Unborn bird inside of it
00:02:49.519 there's enough food to help the chicken
00:02:51.040 grow and grow until she's strong enough
00:02:54.159 to break through the shell it takes her
00:02:57.159 a little while but soon she's free and

00:03:42.879 just a little while ago they were inside
00:03:45.040 an egg well let's put them back inside
00:03:47.239 the incubator so that they'll stay warm
00:03:49.680 and their feathers will fluff up and
00:03:51.519 they'll turn into chickens can you name

00:06:05.800 not going to have a
00:06:07.680 baby that's funny I was sure I was why
00:06:10.479 don't you think Monica's going to have a
00:06:11.720 baby Joy because when my mom was going
00:06:13.800 to have a baby she had a really big
00:06:16.120 tummy oh I see you don't think my
00:06:18.880 tummy's big enough to have a baby inside
00:06:21.120 right yes I think I can explain but um
00:06:25.800 could I have an apple first an apple uh
00:06:28.280 yeah sure
00:06:29.919 Joy do you know how a baby
00:06:32.160 begins no well it's really cool a baby
00:06:36.199 begins as a special cell that's made by
00:06:38.120 a mom and a dad and it lives inside the
00:06:41.280 mother's body and it's really little
00:06:44.479 just like that Freckle on your nose and
00:06:47.919 that's how you began as a special tiny
00:06:50.120 little cell inside your mother's body
00:06:52.720 what happens to it well Christopher
00:06:54.759 begins to grow it becomes two cells and
00:06:57.319 then four cells and pretty soon well
00:06:59.800 here let me show you I went to my doctor
00:07:01.919 today and he gave me these really neat
00:07:04.479 pictures see after a few weeks that tiny
00:07:07.639 cell grows into this that's an embryo
00:07:11.440 and that's what's inside of me right now
00:07:13.319 Joy an embryo and I haven't gotten big
00:07:16.280 yet because the embryo is still really
00:07:18.479 small see it's only about as big as my
00:07:20.560 thumb and it's right here inside me and
00:07:23.120 it keeps growing and getting bigger and
00:07:24.919 bigger every day will you get a big
00:07:27.319 tummy don't worry I'll get enormous oh
00:07:29.879 Monica here's your Apple thanks um could
00:07:32.879 I have some peanut butter on that peanut
00:07:35.120 butter on the Apple
00:07:38.000 mm okay thanks buddy so anyway this
00:07:43.080 embryo it begins to grow and after a
00:07:46.159 while it looks like
00:07:48.479 this it looks like a little person
00:07:51.360 doesn't it we can see its itty bitty
00:07:53.080 feet and hands and head see now it's
00:07:55.680 called a fetus that's spelled f e t u s
00:07:59.319 fetus and that's what we call a baby
00:08:01.599 before it comes out of its mother how
00:08:04.319 does the fetus get food well it just
00:08:06.720 orders out for pizza no it do okay okay
00:08:10.400 you're right it doesn't order out for
00:08:11.919 pizza as a matter of fact it doesn't
00:08:14.159 even eat with its mouth yet see the
00:08:16.120 fetus has a very special way of eating
00:08:18.720 how's that well this may sound a little
00:08:21.319 strange Joy but uh do you have a belly
00:08:25.199 button yes well that's how a fetus gets
00:08:28.599 its food right right through its belly
00:08:31.120 button that's not true no it's true here
00:08:34.839 look I have another picture to show
00:08:36.760 you see there's a tube that comes from
00:08:39.599 the mother and goes right into the belly
00:08:44.000 button of the fetus and through that
00:08:46.200 tube goes all the food and oxygen that
00:08:48.720 the fetus needs to grow that's why I've
00:08:51.480 been so hungry these days you see cuz
00:08:53.440 I'm not just eating for myself I'm also
00:08:56.200 eating for the baby because everything I
00:08:58.240 eat goes through through the tube to the
00:09:00.640 baby so it can keep growing well Monica
00:09:04.079 here is your Apple and peanut butter
00:09:07.519 great you know I would really love a
00:09:10.120 pickle a pickle with the peanut butter
00:09:13.240 and apple what's wrong with
00:09:16.160 that
00:09:19.240 nothing how long does the fetus stay
00:09:21.600 inside you well from the time that
00:09:23.880 special cell begins to grow to the day
00:09:26.640 the baby is born is about 9 months but
00:09:29.360 then when the fetus is big enough and
00:09:32.040 strong enough it comes out Tada the
00:09:34.680 baby's
00:09:35.839 born oh gosh listen guys I'm sorry I
00:09:38.760 have to go my husband and I decided that
00:09:40.560 we would go swimming every day so that I
00:09:42.200 could stay healthy for the baby but I'll
00:09:43.720 see you guys again real soon okay bye
00:09:46.160 Monica see okay Monica here's your
00:09:49.920 pickles she left uh what what did I miss
00:09:54.240 sit down I'll tell
00:09:55.680 you you began as a special cell it's
00:09:59.079 it's made by your mom and your dad and
00:10:01.360 it lives inside of your mother's body
00:10:04.160 the cell grows and grows and becomes an
00:10:08.279 embryo and then a fetus with tiny feet
00:10:11.200 and hands in 9 months you're born every
00:10:15.440 part of you is very small except for
00:10:17.560 your
00:10:22.959 voice and that's how human life begins
00:10:26.320 but what happens then can a b baby take
00:10:29.519 care of itself after it's born well not
00:10:32.040 really babies actually need a lot of
00:10:33.839 help and you might know this if you've
00:10:35.639 ever watched animal babies after they're
00:10:39.330 [Music]
00:10:49.079 born you're brand new and you're pretty
00:10:52.760 helpless too not too much that you can
00:10:55.800 do cuz you're the
00:10:58.040 baby oh you can Babble you can CP people
00:11:02.279 tell you coochie Co why do they act the
00:11:05.560 way they do cuz you're the
00:11:08.720 baby in the middle of the night no one
00:11:13.279 gets up tight when you tell them with no
00:11:16.560 ifs ands buts or
00:11:18.760 maybe you're not crying to be rude but
00:11:22.399 you really want some food that's the way
00:11:26.000 it goes when you're the baby so if you
00:11:30.240 Bab Bay or bark and if you're frightened
00:11:33.639 of the dark just remember this remark
00:11:37.160 and someday maybe you might be a proud
00:11:41.279 mom or dad it might be hard but you'll
00:11:44.120 be glad so don't forget the fun you had

00:14:14.800 that and so we've seen how a baby begins
00:14:18.680 how a very tiny but very special cell
00:14:21.360 inside the mother's body becomes an
00:14:23.519 embryo then it grows into a fetus and
00:14:26.000 about 9 months later the baby's born
00:14:28.320 right out of the mother's body and joy
00:14:30.720 showed us how a newborn baby needs to be

00:16:56.959 picture it's a mosaic Mosaic what's that
00:16:59.959 it's when you use a lot of little things
00:17:01.639 to make one big thing see we're using
00:17:04.079 little pieces of paper oh I get it so
00:17:06.679 you guys are putting together these
00:17:08.240 little tiny pieces of paper and when
00:17:10.839 it's done you get one gigantic picture
00:17:14.039 oh so what's it the picture of we're not
00:17:16.919 t oh come on go oh oh okay okay okay

00:17:27.000 look hi Mr bones nice
00:17:30.679 outfit a lot of little tiny pieces that
00:17:34.320 add up to one big thing you know I like
00:17:36.640 that idea and you know that you are made
00:17:39.320 of many tiny pieces that add up to one
00:17:41.880 big thing uh now they're not pieces of
00:17:44.240 paper like this cuz if they were every
00:17:46.960 time it rains you'd fall apart oh you're
00:17:49.400 made of very tiny pieces that you can't
00:17:51.600 actually see with your eye and your body
00:17:53.640 has oh billions and billions of them
00:17:56.120 what are they they're called cells now
00:17:59.280 not only do you have cells but plants
00:18:01.280 and animals have them too let me show
00:18:03.200 you what I
00:18:04.080 mean I've got some leaves here that uh I
00:18:07.480 just pulled off some plants that were
00:18:09.000 growing outside hello bird hi Bob now
00:18:12.000 these leaves have cells in them but we
00:18:14.360 can't see them right now because they're
00:18:15.919 too small we can't see them just with
00:18:17.480 our eyes but if you want to see things
00:18:19.080 that are very tiny you use one of these
00:18:20.919 things it's called a microscope and it's
00:18:23.600 an instrument that helps you see things
00:18:25.520 that are very very small and all you
00:18:26.880 need to do is just put something like a
00:18:29.440 leaf on the microscope and then we look
00:18:31.720 through this eyepiece it's sort of like
00:18:33.120 a camera I turn the knob until it's
00:18:35.640 focused and whoa look at that doesn't
00:18:38.679 look like a leaf anymore can you see all
00:18:41.320 those little sections they kind of look
00:18:43.240 like rooms in an apartment building well
00:18:45.360 those are the cells and each one of
00:18:47.520 those is one cell now I'm just going to
00:18:49.280 change the magnification here so that we
00:18:51.000 can get a closer
00:18:53.400 look oh
00:18:55.400 yeah now we can see that each cell has a
00:18:58.919 little bit of structure it has what
00:19:00.640 looks like a wall around the outside and
00:19:02.720 then there's a dark spot in the middle
00:19:05.000 now you know if you were to take any
00:19:06.760 part of your body and put it underneath
00:19:08.919 this microscope you would also see that
00:19:10.720 you are made of cells here's a picture
00:19:13.720 of some cells from skin can you see the
00:19:17.000 little sections again and here's a
00:19:19.360 picture of some blood cells now they
00:19:21.679 have a slightly different shape but
00:19:22.840 they're still
00:19:23.960 cells here's some cells from a strand of
00:19:27.240 hair and here are some bone cells so we
00:19:30.559 can look at lots of different things
00:19:32.080 under the microscope and we still see
00:19:34.039 cells we might look at the cells that
00:19:35.600 are in an apple or maybe those that are
00:19:37.960 in a slice of mushroom or even some
00:19:40.799 seeds the cells might have different
00:19:42.880 shapes and different colors but we'd see
00:19:45.080 cells because everything that's alive is
00:19:47.080 made of
00:19:51.900 [Music]
00:19:57.240 cells here's a forest a green green
00:20:01.360 forest what makes a forest everybody
00:20:05.440 sees here's a tree a green green tree
00:20:10.240 what makes a tree everyone
00:20:13.240 agrees here's a leaf a green green leaf
00:20:18.120 what makes a leaf everybody
00:20:21.120 yell here's a cell a tiny tiny cell what
00:20:26.159 makes a cell everybody
00:20:28.880 shout let's find
00:20:32.320 out what CS are all
00:20:35.330 [Music]
00:20:36.760 about let's go
00:20:40.200 see our cells are important to you
00:20:45.000 me let's find
00:20:48.080 out what sales are all
00:20:52.520 about let's go and
00:20:55.960 see my CS are in important to you and me
00:21:01.440 what makes a sell everybody
00:21:04.320 sh let find
00:21:08.400 out let's find
00:21:12.320 out let's
00:21:14.120 [Music]
00:21:20.279 find so what makes a cell well let's
00:21:23.080 have a look these are some models of
00:21:25.200 what cells look like now these models
00:21:27.120 are a lot bigger than real cells but
00:21:29.279 they let us see what they're like on the
00:21:30.520 inside so imagine that we just made
00:21:32.480 ourselves really really tiny so that we
00:21:35.520 could pick up a cell and hold it in our
00:21:37.120 hand it' probably be something like this
00:21:39.760 now cells have many different parts and
00:21:41.400 there's a lot going on inside them on
00:21:43.559 the outside is a skin that's sort of
00:21:45.840 like the outside of this balloon and
00:21:47.720 that just holds everything together on
00:21:49.559 the inside is a liquid so if you could
00:21:52.360 actually hold a s in your hand it would
00:21:54.000 probably be kind of squishy like this
00:21:56.880 now if we were to cut this balloon in
00:21:58.720 half and see the inside of the cell it
00:22:01.799 would look like this one over here so
00:22:03.720 here we have the outside the skin then
00:22:06.640 there's liquid on the inside and in the
00:22:08.520 center is the most important part that's
00:22:10.640 called the nucleus and every cell has a
00:22:12.840 nucleus now if we were to take the
00:22:15.200 nucleus apart and go inside
00:22:17.640 it we'd find something that looks like
00:22:19.880 this it's sort of stringy material
00:22:23.679 that looks a lot like spaghetti and the
00:22:26.720 spaghetti like material is made of
00:22:28.400 something called jeans you ever heard of
00:22:30.880 that word jeans I wonder if the kids
00:22:33.200 have hey everybody have you ever heard
00:22:35.880 the word jeans B I wear jeans all the
00:22:40.880 time I like wearing jeans too this is a
00:22:43.760 different kind these genes are even
00:22:45.880 spelled differently g e n e s Jeans now
00:22:52.159 what's so important about the genes that
00:22:54.400 are inside the stringy material that's
00:22:58.080 inside the nucleus of all the cells that
00:23:00.600 make up your body well to find that out
00:23:03.120 let's go back and have another look at
00:23:04.360 the
00:23:08.039 Mosaic hey guys picture's looking great
00:23:11.120 don't look good at it okay okay okay I
00:23:14.440 won't look listen I just have a question
00:23:15.960 for you how do you know where to put all
00:23:19.200 those little pieces of paper I mean how
00:23:20.679 do you know what colors to use and what
00:23:22.640 shapes to make to get the picture we
00:23:25.000 have a plan a plan yeah on this drawing
00:23:28.000 oh can I see that no Bob then you'll
00:23:30.640 know what it looks like okay I promise I
00:23:32.640 won't look at it well the important
00:23:34.480 thing is they have a plan and a plan
00:23:37.279 means that they already know what colors
00:23:39.120 to use and what the shapes are going to
00:23:41.080 look like just wish they'd tell me about
00:23:46.000 it you know this may sound funny but
00:23:49.320 your cells have a plan for what you look
00:23:52.080 like inside each of your cells is a plan
00:23:54.640 a set of directions that determine what
00:23:56.799 color your eyes are what color your hair
00:23:58.799 is how tall you are even what shape you
00:24:01.400 have and these directions are in the
00:24:03.400 genes of your cells remember the
00:24:06.919 genes here's a real cell inside of those
00:24:10.600 genes is the plan that tells your body
00:24:13.039 how to grow now watch this the cell is
00:24:16.799 starting to stretch in a moment it's
00:24:19.159 going to
00:24:20.360 split that's how you grow cells divide
00:24:23.520 creating more and more
00:24:26.799 cells
00:24:29.720 now look at these three cells they all
00:24:32.679 look the same don't they but each one of
00:24:34.720 them has a different set of genes so
00:24:37.120 they'll grow into three different types
00:24:38.960 of living things can you guess what
00:24:41.200 they're going to grow
00:24:43.360 into cells grow by dividing and then
00:24:46.360 dividing again and again adding more and
00:24:48.880 more cells but still it's hard to guess
00:24:51.520 what the cells are going to
00:24:56.360 become ah the cells are now starting to
00:24:59.200 form
00:25:00.799 babies but they still look pretty much
00:25:02.960 the
00:25:03.580 [Music]
00:25:10.880 same now can you tell what they are each
00:25:14.039 one is closer to being born and each one
00:25:16.279 is starting to look very different one
00:25:18.600 has a small beak that looks like a bird
00:25:21.600 another one has small hands and feet
00:25:23.880 it's going to grow into a human baby and
00:25:26.320 the third has ears and Tails
00:25:28.200 that's going to become a kitten in a few
00:25:30.799 weeks they'll all be born or hatched and
00:25:33.279 then they'll be very different from each
00:25:36.960 other but they all began the same way as
00:25:40.039 a single cell they grew into different
00:25:42.640 living things because each cell had
00:25:44.799 different genes a different plan for
00:25:47.000 what the cell would
00:25:49.230 [Music]
00:25:51.279 become coming along every person in the
00:25:54.760 world has their own special set of genes
00:25:57.320 their own special plan for who they are
00:25:59.600 and you can tell this if you just look
00:26:00.919 around at all your friends they're
00:26:02.559 different aren't they some are tall some
00:26:04.399 are short some have red hair some have
00:26:07.120 dark skin everyone is very different
00:26:09.720 because everyone has a different set of
00:26:14.880 jeans you know it's kind of funny in
00:26:17.480 many ways all human beings are the same
00:26:20.240 I mean we all breathe in air through our
00:26:22.320 lungs we all use our senses our noses
00:26:25.080 are in the middle of our face we have
00:26:27.120 two eyes two ears 10 fingers and toes
00:26:29.880 and so many other things that are the
00:26:31.279 same but in other ways we're all very
00:26:34.240 different and I guess that's good
00:26:35.799 because it would be pretty boring if we
00:26:37.600 were all exactly the same so it's good
00:26:40.159 that we have different genes it makes
00:26:42.360 the world a much more interesting
00:26:56.600 place
00:27:16.480 every living thing is made up of cells a
00:27:19.640 cell has several parts in the middle is
00:27:22.840 the nucleus and in the nucleus are
00:27:25.960 genes genes are the plan for how a
00:27:29.000 living thing will grow what kind of
00:27:31.360 animal it will be what color it will be
00:27:34.120 what shape it will
00:27:35.480 be cells divide that's how you
00:27:38.960 grow every person in the world has their
00:27:41.880 own special
00:27:43.830 [Music]
00:27:48.159 genes well is this thing finished can I
00:27:50.640 look at it now yeah well it's
00:27:53.679 interesting but is this the way you
00:27:55.000 wanted it to turn out yes see here's the
00:27:57.080 plan a plan wow yeah you're right look
00:28:00.200 there's there's the tree and the fence
00:28:02.760 and the grass well so you already knew
00:28:05.320 what this was going to look like before
00:28:06.679 you even started yeah yeah wow do you
00:28:09.559 like
00:28:10.600 it um no you don't I love it oh yeah
00:28:17.480 yeah it's just little pieces of paper
00:28:20.919 yeah like about a million of them yeah
00:28:23.880 it sure is it's amazing how how
00:28:26.640 something so
00:28:28.120 wonderful can be made of just little
00:28:30.320 tiny pieces and now we know something
00:28:32.720 else that's wonderful that's made up of
00:28:34.559 a lot of little tiny things





00:30:19.760 cells your starting place this segment
00:30:23.039 covers the parts and functions of a cell
00:30:25.600 genetic traits and the import of good
00:30:43.780 [Music]
00:30:55.600 health in a heart beat this segment
00:30:58.639 talks about the circulatory system and
00:31:00.799 the importance of eating healthy food
00:31:02.880 and
00:31:12.799 exercising when you get up in the
00:31:15.080 morning and look in the mirror you see
00:31:17.159 your eyes mouth teeth hair ears and nose
00:31:20.240 your muscles and Bones give you a real
00:31:22.279 good place for you to wear your clothes
00:31:25.960 you got your lungs and stomach and brain
00:31:28.440 and heart what we think and feel is a
00:31:30.840 very important part of how we're put
00:31:33.480 together why we do what we do why I look
00:31:36.120 like me and you look like you it's a
00:31:38.720 bunch of neat stuff it's fun to know
00:31:41.519 watch listen and learn
00:31:49.120 [Music]
00:31:55.320 with Bob says give give me a stupid
00:31:58.880 smile yeah Bob says put both your
00:32:01.519 fingers on your nose okay Bob says cross
00:32:04.919 your eyes you do that Bob says make a
00:32:09.320 funny
00:32:10.490 [Music]
00:32:12.559 face hi we're playing a game of Bob says
00:32:15.679 it's my favorite game that's cuz I'm Bob
00:32:19.519 okay Bob says move your fingers like
00:32:22.519 spiders big daddy longleg spiders yeah
00:32:26.039 that's pretty good okay Bob says don't
00:32:29.159 move anything that's easy ah yeah but
00:32:33.559 don't move anything outside or inside
00:32:36.320 your body don't
00:32:38.639 blink don't breathe don't move
00:32:42.639 anything I feel something
00:32:45.559 moving where do you feel something
00:32:47.880 moving right here can you make it stop I
00:32:50.799 don't think so isn't that interesting
00:32:53.919 there's something beating inside you and
00:32:56.120 you don't even think about it well
00:32:57.919 that's your heart and it's a pretty
00:32:59.159 amazing muscle okay one more Bob says
00:33:02.639 try to feel your heartbeat do that put
00:33:05.399 your hand on your chest like this hold
00:33:07.519 really
00:33:08.760 still beat beat beat Can you feel it
00:33:12.159 mine
00:33:14.120 going can you feel your heart beating
00:33:16.279 inside your chest beep beep beep beep
00:33:19.519 okay how many times do you think your
00:33:21.840 heart beats like that every hour what do
00:33:24.240 you think Diego 100 100 times an hour
00:33:27.000 what do you think Joy 200 200 what do
00:33:29.880 you think Christopher I
00:33:32.000 think a thousand a thousand times that's
00:33:35.039 quite a lot would you believe that your
00:33:37.120 heart beats almost 4,000 times every
00:33:40.559 hour 4,000 times and it never stops and
00:33:43.399 that's what we're going to talk about is
00:33:44.840 your heart how it beats and what it does
00:33:46.880 inside your body and I want to show you
00:33:48.639 something really neat it's over here
00:33:50.320 let's
00:33:53.639 go your heart is really like a pump now
00:33:56.760 any anybody know what this red thing is
00:33:58.440 when you moove the handle water comes
00:34:00.080 out that's right Christopher this is a
00:34:02.080 water pump and we can see some of the
00:34:03.799 parts of it here down below there's a
00:34:05.559 jar and it's got some water inside we
00:34:07.519 colored it blue so that you can see it a
00:34:08.839 little better and coming out of the jar
00:34:10.719 is a tube and the tube goes up into the
00:34:13.040 pump and then we have a big bucket over
00:34:14.918 here now suppose we want to move the
00:34:17.320 water from the jar to the bucket is it
00:34:19.679 going to move by itself no no of course
00:34:22.119 not we need a pump right who wants to
00:34:24.199 work the pump I okay okay the handle's
00:34:26.359 nice and big want to all three of you
00:34:27.800 try it okay go ahead just pump see what
00:34:31.760 happens now the water's coming up the
00:34:34.320 tube and whoa pumping out the
00:34:38.800 pump is that a great
00:34:44.119 pump your heart really is like that
00:34:47.079 water pump because it pumps something
00:34:48.918 through your
00:34:50.040 body but what is that something is it
00:34:53.839 water like the
00:34:55.399 pump is it
00:34:57.640 air like this air
00:34:59.280 pump or is it blood well your heart
00:35:02.839 pumps blood you ever thought about your
00:35:04.920 blood I thought about it yesterday when
00:35:07.119 I cut my finger all this blood came out
00:35:09.680 I had to put a Band-Aid on it but why
00:35:11.920 would my heart be pumping blood all the
00:35:14.040 way from my chest down my arm and up to
00:35:16.520 my finger well blood feeds my finger
00:35:19.359 blood takes the good stuff out of the
00:35:20.960 food you eat and the air that you
00:35:22.200 breathe and it feeds your fingers your
00:35:24.800 muscles your brain all of your body
00:35:27.720 you ever seen what your heart looks like
00:35:31.119 well it doesn't look like this that's a
00:35:34.200 valentine here's what your real heart
00:35:36.119 looks like I have one over
00:35:38.960 here your heart looks something like
00:35:41.680 that it's not very big it's only about
00:35:43.359 the size of your fist and it sits in
00:35:45.680 your chest right about here and it beats
00:35:48.240 be be be be be be and you know what
00:35:50.920 strange about it is that it's hollow
00:35:52.839 inside now I have another one here
00:35:54.640 that's a little bigger so that you can
00:35:56.119 see it come on run in close so you can
00:35:57.560 see what it looks like and we can open
00:36:00.119 the sides of it and look inside and you
00:36:02.920 can see that it's Hollow in there and
00:36:05.160 that's where the blood goes so the blood
00:36:06.800 comes in some of these tubes it fills up
00:36:08.960 the inside of the heart and then because
00:36:10.640 the heart's a muscle it can squeeze so
00:36:12.839 it squeezes tight and then all the blood
00:36:15.000 comes gushing out again and then the
00:36:16.520 heart relaxes and some more blood goes
00:36:18.520 in and then it squeezes it again and
00:36:20.400 forces the blood out and every time the
00:36:22.280 heart does that when it squeezes that's

00:39:55.520 and extra oxygen so your brain tells
00:39:58.000 your heart to beat faster so it can get
00:40:00.119 that extra food and oxygen to your
00:40:01.760 muscles so that they can get the job

00:47:26.240 wow that is amazing how'd you do that
00:47:29.800 well most people just move whenever they
00:47:32.280 want whenever they
00:47:34.839 want that is
00:47:38.079 amazing yes it is amazing how we can
00:47:40.760 move without using strings like little
00:47:43.240 Larry here but how do we move well maybe
00:47:46.839 Mr Bones can give us a clue right oh hi
00:47:51.520 Mr Bones hi Mr Bones nice hat child do
00:47:54.240 you know how many bones we have in in
00:47:55.839 our
00:47:56.520 body 100 100 that's a good guess that's
00:47:59.520 a lot would you believe we have twice as
00:48:01.480 many as that 200 bones in our body
00:48:04.440 that's a lot that is a lot and bones do
00:48:06.440 a lot I mean they give us support so
00:48:08.440 that we don't fall down into a Big Blob
00:48:10.119 of skin they give us our shape so that
00:48:12.160 we look like people and because they're
00:48:14.240 hard they protect us but there's one
00:48:16.760 thing that bones cannot do not by
00:48:19.200 themselves they can't move they need
00:48:21.880 something to help them move just like
00:48:23.559 Larry the marionette needed strings so
00:48:25.480 he could move his arms and the legs our
00:48:27.319 bones need something so that we can do
00:48:29.800 things like raise an arm can you raise
00:48:31.400 Mr Bone's arm yeah bones need help to do
00:48:33.960 that or to raise a leg can you raise his
00:48:35.640 leg yeah even to move our jaw so that we
00:48:39.920 can talk all right how's it going child
00:48:42.680 do you know what it is that our bones
00:48:44.119 need to move muscles muscles right it's
00:48:47.280 our muscles that keep us on the move can

00:48:50.760 bones yeah move everything you got
00:48:53.200 here lots of Bones lots of muscles

00:49:10.119 have what would you
00:49:12.280 guess you have about 600
00:49:15.799 muscles 600 and they do the work of
00:49:18.680 helping you move hey Bob What's happen

00:50:40.520 my arms comes up and it gets small when
00:50:42.480 my arm goes down that's right that's the
00:50:44.760 big muscle that moves your arm up here
00:50:47.000 when you want to move your arm your
00:50:48.280 brain says to to this muscle right here
00:50:50.480 it says squeeze and the muscle squeezes
00:50:53.319 and shortens and that pulls the bones in
00:50:55.480 your arm so your arm bends then when the
00:50:57.520 muscle relaxes your arm can come back
00:50:59.839 down again and actually there's another
00:51:01.400 muscle can you feel on the underside of
00:51:03.079 your arm right under here there's
00:51:04.559 another muscle and this muscle is what
00:51:06.599 you use when you push your arm out like
00:51:09.000 that it causes your arm to straight so
00:51:10.319 this one pulls to straighten your arm
00:51:11.920 and this one up here squeezes to bring
00:51:14.119 your arm back up you know there's
00:51:16.280 another place where you can see lots of
00:51:17.920 muscles in action and that's when you

00:51:33.680 and fast see the muscles in their hind
00:51:36.720 legs getting tight and then relaxing
00:51:39.200 over and over again so the legs can
00:51:42.599 move you can really see her muscles
00:51:45.000 Rippling as she
00:51:46.559 runs even when animals are playing their
00:51:49.400 muscles work
00:51:50.880 hard but animals use their muscles for
00:51:53.280 more than just running and jumping and
00:51:55.359 any movement no matter how tiny involves
00:51:57.559 muscles and Naomi is going to show how
