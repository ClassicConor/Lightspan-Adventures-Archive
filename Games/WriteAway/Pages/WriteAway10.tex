\subsection{The Sleigh Ride by Angela Dibella}

SABRINA:
Here we are back at Write Away.
We have received some wonderful stories written by students like you from all across the nation.
Today is no exception.
It's amazing how with just two simple objects, a pencil and paper, your creativity has taken us all over the world, and introduced us to some very special people.
Our first story is a great example of how you can use your imagination to meet someone special, or travel to a place you've only ever imagined.
Our first author is Angela Dibella.
She's a second grader from Apalachee School in Tallahassee, Florida.
Come with us, as Angela takes us on an exciting sleigh ride.

ANGELA:
Hi everyone, here we are at the North Pole, the home of Santa Claus himself.
It's Christmas Eve, and I'm here to help Santa with all the presents he has to deliver.
Follow me.

MRS SANTA CLAUS:
And Bobby Jones from Minneapolis wants a football.

SANTA:
Check.

ANGELA:
Hi Santa.
Hi Mrs Claus.

SANTA:
Haha Angela, what are you doing up here at the North Pole?
And on the night before Christmas?

ANGELA:
I thought you could use some help, so here I am!

MRS SANTA CLAUS:
Oh we're so glad you're here, Angela.
The list of children that have been nice is extremely long this year.
We could really use your help.

ANGELA:
Well I'm ready.
What should we do first?

MRS SANTA CLAUS:
Let's make some hot cocoa.
Oh Santa always loves a cup of cocoa before he goes on one of his sleigh rides.

ANGELA:
Mmm...
It smells great.
Here's your coco Santa!

SANTA;
Well thank you Angela.
Mmm delicious.

ANGELA:
Well, what can I do now?

SANTA:
Would you please feed the reindeer for us?

ANGELA:
Oh I'd love to!

MRS SANTA CLAUS:
Right that way.

ANGELA:
You know Rudolph, your job is very important, because you light the way, so that Santa can see where all the houses are all over the world.

SANTA:
Hoho, very good.
Thanks to you Angela, I'm all ready to go.

ANGELA:
Santa, can I come with you and help you drive the sleigh?

SANTA:
Huhu, why of course!
Let's go.

ANGELA (VOICE OVER):
This was the best part of all.
I got to help Santa deliver presents to all the good little boys and girls.

ANGELA:
We've got a long ride ahead of us, so we better say goodbye for now.

SANTA:
Hohoho, Merry Christmas.

ANGELA:
The sleigh ride.
The end.

\subsection{The Thing in the Gym by Jennifer Wisdon}

JOE:
My favorite part of this job is reading all the scary stories that you've written for us.
Eugh.
You know, then kind of make your skin crawl and your spine tingle.
A good scary story has all the ingredients of suspense and mystery, and our next author has me holding on to my breath till the very, very end.
Jennifer Wisdom, a third grader from Central Elementary in Duncanville, Texas, has her characters clean everything up in 'The Thing in the Gym'.

PETER:
Yuh, my name is Peter, and I want to tell you a true story about the thing in the gym.
Well, people say that it's a ghost that lives in the gym, but I never believed them.
My Story begins.

PETER (VOICE OVER):
I was in the gym playing basketball with my friend when my tooth got accidentally knocked out.

GIRL 1:
Oh man, I'm sorry.

PETER:
Oh, it's okay, it's just my back tooth.
But there it is.

GIRL 1:
Wow!

PETER.
Here, I'll just stick it up here and I'll take it home later when I go home.

GIRL 1:
Okay, come on, let's keep playing!

PETER (VOICE OVER):
After play[ing], I forgot about my tooth and went home.

GIRL 1:
Augh man, look at the time.
I gotta go home.

PETER:
Yeah, me too.

GIRL 1:
Let's go.

PETER (VOICE OVER):
The next day when I went back to get my tooth, it was gone.
So I asked the janitor if he'd seen my tooth.

PETER:
Have you seen a tooth?

JANITOR:
A tooth you say?
No, I found a banana peel and some smelly gym socks and, and a lot of [that picture of Neil Sedaka].
But no tooth.
Ah, don't worry, son.
Your tooth will grow back.
Hey, maybe the thing in the gym took it.
Or maybe it was a ghost.

PETER:
I-I don't believe in ghosts.

JANITOR:
Well maybe and maybe not.
I gotta go clean the showers.
Later dude.

PETER (VOICE OVER):
Well, while the janitor was cleaning out the showers, something very weird happened.
Someone or something dropped a bottle of shampoo on the janitor's head.
Something was definitely going on.
So I decided to find out what it was, and got my sister Carrie to help.

PETER:
So, do we have all our supplies?

CARRIE:
Yes.
Stew for dinner, a camera, and the first aid kit, in case one of us gets attacked by that thing in the gym.

PETER:
Okay, let's go.

CARRIE:
I-I don't see anything, just some balloons and streamers for the dance tomorrow night.
Let's go home.

PETER:
No, no.
This is where all the mysterious accidents have occurred.
In the gym, and in the boy's shower room.
Come on.

CARRIE:
Well, I'm not going in there, pee-ew!

PETER:
Quiet!
I think I hear something.

PETER (VOICE OVER):
Suddenly, we heard popping sounds, and that's when we saw it.

PETER:
*panicked*
I'll get it, you take a picture!
Aah, take a picture!

CARRIE:
Okay!
I got it!
Let's go home!
*new scene*
I got it, I got it, I got the film development.

PETER:
Good, let me see it, let me see it.

CARRIE:
It's furry, with big teeth, and a mask on.
It's - it's...

PETER:
It's a raccoon!
You mean, a terrifying thing in the gym...
was just a raccoon?
That popping sound we heard was the raccoon popping the balloons from the dance.

CARRIE:
Yeah, and everyone knows raccoons like to steal things.
He probably took your tooth, and dumped the shampoo on the janitor's head.
Hey, hey, let's call the zoo and get them to come catch the raccoon and take care of him.

PETER:
Yeah, good idea.

PETER (VOICE OVER):
The next day, the Zookeeper met us at the gym.

ZOOKEEPER:
What's up?
You say you have a wild beast for the zoo?

PETER:
No, it's not a wild beast.

CARRIE:
It's a raccoon!

ZOOKEEPER:
What?
No man-eating, vicious, slobbering wild beast?

PETER, CARRIE:
No!

ZOOKEEPER:
Good.
Come on, let's go catch that raccoon.
Here little raccoon, come here.
    [Come here] little raccoon.

*whispering*
It's got your tooth.
Give it to me!
It's got lots of people's teeth!
Take [it]! Take it!
And I've gotcha!
All right, now I'm gonna take you to the zoo and give you a nice new home.
Well, we gotta go, bye kids.
Thanks!

CARRIE:
Bye.

PETER (VOICE OVER):
Once the Zookeeper took the raccoon to the zoo, everything went back to normal.
Until till weird things started happening in the... cafeteria!
The end!
