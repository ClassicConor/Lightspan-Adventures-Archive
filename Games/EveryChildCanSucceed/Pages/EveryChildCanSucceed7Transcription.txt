00:00:49.600 when i first came here
00:00:51.600 this was in 74
00:00:53.760 and the first test score state test
00:00:55.440 scores came out our third graders were
00:00:56.960 reading at a three percentile
00:00:59.760 it took us four years to get them over
00:01:02.719 the 50 percentile well let's go where
00:01:05.199 you belong
00:01:06.240 no one wanted to come to this school
00:01:08.320 either as a teacher nor as an
00:01:10.560 administrator and i certainly can tell
00:01:12.560 you i didn't want to be here
00:01:16.479 i wouldn't trade this school for a
00:01:18.159 minute now not for a minute
00:01:26.210 
00:01:46.960 this program tells the story of two
00:01:49.040 schools in greater los angeles
00:01:52.000 our first stop is the bennett q
00:01:53.840 elementary school in inglewood
00:01:55.439 california just outside the los angeles
00:01:58.399 city limits
00:02:00.159 there is a solid middle-class core in
00:02:02.079 the region served by bennett q
00:02:04.320 but the school also serves a large poor
00:02:06.560 transient population
00:02:08.399 nearly 60 percent of the students who
00:02:10.399 attend bennett q
00:02:12.000 are eligible for the subsidized lunch
00:02:14.319 program
00:02:15.680 despite the demographic odds
00:02:18.000 bennett q's achievement scores have
00:02:20.000 improved considerably for example third
00:02:23.360 grade math scores have moved from the
00:02:25.440 lowest to the highest quartile in the
00:02:27.760 state
00:02:29.360 this success has taken place under the
00:02:31.519 leadership of principal nancy ichinaga
00:02:34.720 the keys
00:02:43.280 people
00:02:44.239 have a notion that kids from
00:02:47.760 minority kids in particular from irving
00:02:50.160 urban settings and in urban public
00:02:52.319 schools
00:02:53.440 really
00:02:54.480 are not or cannot do very well
00:02:57.599 and i
00:02:58.800 really
00:02:59.680 have to refute that point of view
00:03:02.879 is that your science fair project yeah
00:03:04.959 good
00:03:05.840 my kids do as well or better than kids
00:03:08.879 just about anywhere
00:03:10.480 first of all we believe that the school
00:03:12.319 must be a safe place for all kids
00:03:18.000 we also expect the kids to come to
00:03:20.000 school believing that it's their time to
00:03:23.040 be serious students
00:03:25.750 
00:03:27.840 and we do believe that every child can
00:03:31.200 learn to read to write and to be a
00:03:33.120 successful student
00:03:34.770 
00:03:36.000 lulu you need to work with five remember
00:03:39.440 let's start all over again
00:03:41.519 we have worked out a system where
00:03:45.440 everybody
00:03:46.400 is taught specific things that make them
00:03:48.799 successful student and it's what every
00:03:52.159 teacher does
00:03:54.000 in there for me
00:03:55.640 
00:03:57.360 the system begins in kindergarten where
00:04:00.080 teacher charlotte watanabe is laying the
00:04:02.159 foundations for later success in reading
00:04:04.959 and math
00:04:06.159 very good you use a lot of colors in
00:04:08.319 this pattern five different colors
00:04:10.720 kindergarten is a very important very
00:04:13.280 good do you think you'll be able to
00:04:15.040 finish it
00:04:16.478 oh terrific we want to see that we don't
00:04:18.639 make them feel good about themselves by
00:04:21.040 making them succeed in whatever they do
00:04:22.800 in the classroom you know they're going
00:04:24.479 to start feeling like failures from the
00:04:26.720 very beginning so we want them to
00:04:29.280 succeed here we want them to feel good
00:04:31.600 about what they do so whatever tasks
00:04:33.520 they have we give them a lot of praise
00:04:36.639 okay tell us how many red blocks and how
00:04:38.720 many white blocks you used
00:04:44.880 good for you
00:04:46.320 how about this one right over here this
00:04:47.840 looks interesting
00:04:51.759 what we do here in kindergarten with all
00:04:53.759 these manipulatives is to build a good
00:04:56.160 foundation of the understanding of the
00:04:58.880 concepts we're building so that when
00:05:00.560 they go up to first grade second grade
00:05:02.479 to the upper grades they'll have a
00:05:04.160 strong understanding of what exactly
00:05:06.800 they're doing
00:05:08.720 in those grades when they are working
00:05:10.240 with computations
00:05:14.639 very good okay what number were you
00:05:17.199 working with
00:05:18.479 five yes
00:05:19.840 point to the frags that's larger one
00:05:21.840 four the building block approach
00:05:23.440 continues through the primary grades
00:05:26.160 so that by the time students reach
00:05:27.759 howard rothenberg's fifth grade
00:05:30.080 they have a solid grounding in the
00:05:31.600 basics that they need to achieve success
00:05:34.000 in math
00:05:35.440 today's lesson deals with fractions if
00:05:37.520 you had a pie and you cut it into four
00:05:39.759 pieces then you'll have more than if you
00:05:42.400 had a
00:05:43.280 pie and you cut it into ten pieces
00:05:44.800 you'll have small pieces okay that's a
00:05:46.720 good explanation obviously if you don't
00:05:48.560 have the foundations from first second
00:05:50.080 third grade you can't begin fourth grade
00:05:52.320 where you need to start and you have to
00:05:53.840 go back and remediate and you're losing
00:05:55.280 time and the children and that's what
00:05:56.639 happens in most inner city schools the
00:05:58.000 children are
00:05:59.280 years behind
00:06:00.560 because every year has to go back and
00:06:01.919 repeat what they did not learn
00:06:02.960 previously well we do not have that
00:06:04.479 problem here for the most part now make
00:06:06.639 sure you have the decimal in the right
00:06:08.160 place in your answers also we have a
00:06:09.919 very structured curriculum at each grade
00:06:11.919 level and every teacher knows what he or
00:06:13.680 she is responsible to teach
00:06:15.600 so that the following year's teacher can
00:06:16.960 take up at that spot and the kids you
00:06:18.800 know well just are pretty much a grade
00:06:20.560 level be the same number then you can
00:06:21.759 add the zero that's the same that's the
00:06:23.280 answer right
00:06:25.919 oh you got that one right
00:06:28.160 whenever new students enroll at our
00:06:30.400 school i do a quick check
00:06:33.680 i do it because i want to know where
00:06:35.680 they're at academically i also want to
00:06:37.840 get to know them and i want to meet the
00:06:39.680 parents
00:06:40.720 and do a little
00:06:42.720 work on letting them know what they're
00:06:44.240 all about okay i see two problems number
00:06:46.880 one you know math okay number one you
00:06:48.720 got to learn your fractions
00:06:51.680 and i want to talk to your mom so she
00:06:53.039 can go to drugstore and buy you a
00:06:54.960 workbook on fractions and you can work
00:06:56.880 on it and i'll teach you how to one of
00:06:58.880 the very important things about our
00:07:00.400 school is that our kids are held
00:07:02.160 accountable for their learning in other
00:07:04.560 words we have expectations by grade
00:07:06.800 level for every kid in spelling
00:07:09.919 she's a little behind think about a 3.6
00:07:15.440 okay now in math she's right she's and
00:07:18.400 the kids and the parents know from the
00:07:20.319 very very beginning that if they are in
00:07:22.800 kindergarten
00:07:24.240 these are the things they have to master
00:07:26.400 before the year is over and if they
00:07:28.479 don't they probably will not go on to
00:07:30.479 the next grade so
00:07:32.160 a kid doing real good in fourth grade
00:07:34.000 would be able to do all these problems
00:07:36.400 let's go for it get your brain turned on
00:07:38.240 ready yes say cry
00:07:41.599 show me
00:07:43.120 sound
00:07:44.800 bennett q's curriculum focuses on math
00:07:47.520 and reading say sheep she show me
00:07:52.000 reading presents a special challenge
00:07:54.160 since nearly 40 percent of the students
00:07:56.080 are hispanic
00:07:57.440 many with english has their second
00:07:59.120 language
00:08:00.639 good afternoon everyone good afternoon
00:08:05.039 how are you today
00:08:06.980 
00:08:08.879 special classes like this one
00:08:11.199 are available to help spanish-speaking
00:08:13.039 children improve their english
00:08:14.800 comprehension
00:08:17.400 
00:08:19.039 i do believe
00:08:20.240 that if you want to learn english you
00:08:22.160 have to learn english
00:08:24.000 i don't believe that you're going to
00:08:25.759 learn english by learning spanish
00:08:29.759 parents
00:08:30.879 when they came to our school expected
00:08:32.958 the kids to be taught in english they
00:08:34.719 didn't expect us to be able to do it in
00:08:36.958 spanish everybody read it for me
00:08:41.460 
00:08:43.039 let me see a big frown
00:08:45.680 every time i say let me see a frown it
00:08:47.360 makes us want to smile doesn't it let me
00:08:48.959 see a smile
00:08:50.399 which is better
00:08:51.760 wow oh i knew you were going to say that
00:08:54.720 okay teach reading the bennett q
00:08:56.880 curriculum relies heavily on phonics
00:09:00.000 it's a curriculum that the faculty
00:09:01.839 strongly supports since they helped to
00:09:04.080 write it
00:09:05.279 everybody
00:09:07.440 what we do is make sure everyone learns
00:09:11.200 when nancy came in and things were sort
00:09:13.760 of haphazard the first thing that she
00:09:16.000 did was to to start rewriting curriculum
00:09:19.600 and we've all done a lot of that
00:09:20.959 together as as teachers so that everyone
00:09:23.680 can be successful
00:09:25.080 
00:09:28.640 by the time they reach third grade
00:09:31.120 bennett q students are reading and
00:09:32.959 discussing books like charlotte's web
00:09:35.760 under the guidance of teacher mary lou
00:09:37.760 reingold
00:09:40.480 okay discussion question
00:09:43.360 in charlotte's web as in every book
00:09:45.200 there's a theme or a main idea and one
00:09:48.480 of the most important themes in this
00:09:50.399 story is about friendship
00:09:53.040 a really important ask aspect of
00:09:55.519 friendship is sacrifice
00:09:58.320 and who can give me an example in
00:10:00.480 charlotte's web of when
00:10:03.200 charlotte when did she sacrifice
00:10:06.240 jonathan b
00:10:07.680 when she said she said that she wasn't
00:10:10.160 um it was too inconvenient for him for
00:10:12.480 her to go but she went anywhere nowhere
00:10:14.880 to the fair exactly okay now think in
00:10:17.760 your life
00:10:19.839 when have you been sacrificing remember
00:10:22.480 i know you've all helped people you're
00:10:24.240 great helpers but when have you helped
00:10:26.640 when you didn't want to
00:10:29.120 um elizabeth when i was um i was
00:10:32.640 sleeping at home and my knee she broke
00:10:35.040 the lamp where she was throwing balls
00:10:37.279 and um she came to me in my bedroom she
00:10:39.760 woke me up and i told her i didn't want
00:10:41.440 to help her to
00:10:42.800 stay out of trouble because i was too
00:10:44.560 sleepy but did you help her
00:10:46.959 how come
00:10:48.160 because i didn't want her to get in
00:10:49.440 trouble that's neat that's a great
00:10:51.440 example it's exciting to see these
00:10:53.680 children being able to read and to be
00:10:55.519 able to digest a story like charlotte's
00:10:57.120 web and get the meaning out of it
00:11:01.360 the school's special because it's run so
00:11:04.079 well
00:11:05.279 nancy the principal is ahead of her time
00:11:07.600 she knows where we all need to be moving
00:11:09.839 so she keeps us on track
00:11:12.399 i monitor
00:11:13.680 what happens in the classrooms by
00:11:16.800 periodic tests which the teachers all
00:11:19.200 give and every teacher in every grade
00:11:20.640 level gives the same test how do you say
00:11:22.800 this word
00:11:24.399 by carefully monitoring the performance
00:11:26.399 of each student nancy ichinaga ensures
00:11:29.519 consistency across the curriculum
00:11:31.920 and helps teachers identify and correct
00:11:34.160 any weaknesses in their approach okay to
00:11:36.640 find out or to make out okay so so do
00:11:39.680 that okay look at your post here nancy
00:11:42.320 and cheryl draper
00:11:43.760 brainstorm with new fourth grade
00:11:45.519 teachers to find better ways to assess
00:11:47.600 the writing skills of their students
00:11:51.120 could you guys kind of take a look at
00:11:52.480 them and come up with something that's
00:11:53.680 more usable for you guys could we even
00:11:55.839 give it instead of one three or four
00:11:57.519 could we give it a content score and a
00:11:58.959 mechanic score yeah because they're
00:12:00.880 they're
00:12:01.839 they they have something to do with one
00:12:03.279 another but
00:12:07.279 these assessments
00:12:08.800 really help us
00:12:10.480 stay on focus it helps particularly the
00:12:13.120 new teachers because you know they
00:12:14.560 really have no idea what it is they're
00:12:15.920 supposed to teach and this way they
00:12:18.240 learn
00:12:19.200 this is what we need to cover
00:12:21.680 and so they're they're more successful
00:12:23.680 you know right about real stuff
00:12:26.000 nancy shows her support for her teachers
00:12:28.480 in many ways in in small ways
00:12:32.079 and in in large ways
00:12:34.240 when someone's having a problem and
00:12:35.920 nancy needs to deal with it i feel she
00:12:38.320 approaches it as a
00:12:40.639 group as a team effort you know we
00:12:44.240 we can we need to work on this you know
00:12:46.560 what can we do how can i help you to
00:12:49.519 change whatever it is she feels needs to
00:12:52.480 be a little better and and
00:12:55.200 whether it's an individual or as a grade
00:12:57.279 level we usually kind of brainstorm and
00:12:59.440 come up with
00:13:00.880 with some ideas on things that can be
00:13:03.200 changed and i think you have to focus in
00:13:05.519 on you know if it's descriptive then you
00:13:07.120 got to use good verbs
00:13:09.200 if you get a good
00:13:10.639 principle
00:13:11.680 who knows what she's talking about and
00:13:14.000 knows curriculum and knows her people
00:13:16.480 then then anyone can do it and and not
00:13:19.519 no one should take excuses we don't have
00:13:21.440 excuses for why children can't learn
00:13:26.150 
00:13:28.000 right
00:13:29.040 our main focus is to make our kids
00:13:30.720 successful
00:13:32.480 we don't teach because
00:13:34.399 we need a job we teach primarily because
00:13:39.120 school is for kids
00:13:42.560 good okay all together use how many for
00:13:44.959 each train of cubes
00:13:47.120 five okay good job will you take that
00:13:48.959 long and reach your mommy and daddy okay
00:13:51.360 good good job ron
00:13:53.519 oh look uh lotum you finished your
00:13:55.760 butterfly picture
00:13:57.839 excellent okay let me see very nice
00:14:00.399 beautiful oh everybody's spelled clown
00:14:02.720 let's say it clown
00:14:05.440 we have a very nurturing environment we
00:14:07.760 think that's very important we have a
00:14:09.440 place where kids can work hard where
00:14:11.519 they can feel good about themselves
00:14:13.440 where they can be successful
00:14:15.330 
00:14:25.430 
00:14:30.360 
00:14:40.480 i think that a child who doesn't feel
00:14:43.199 good about himself
00:14:44.880 can not feel good about the world
00:14:48.079 so we we try to make
00:14:50.639 every one of our kids successful at
00:14:52.639 least academically so whatever may be
00:14:55.920 wrong with another part of his life at
00:14:57.680 least this part is good
00:15:00.850 
00:15:12.399 our second los angeles school is located
00:15:15.199 in a predominantly mexican-american
00:15:17.120 section of the city
00:15:19.040 the school is euclid avenue elementary
00:15:22.480 there are more than 1200 students
00:15:24.320 attending euclid avenue 93 of them are
00:15:28.000 hispanic
00:15:29.360 over 90 percent are eligible for the
00:15:31.360 subsidized lunch program
00:15:33.360 and the majority are from single parent
00:15:35.600 families
00:15:38.079 if you want to keep up with what's
00:15:39.600 happening at euclid avenue school in the
00:15:41.440 heart of east los angeles
00:15:43.920 just follow these reeboks but be
00:15:46.160 prepared to hurry esther mcshane and her
00:15:48.720 school are on the move
00:15:50.480 i do not spend my time during the day
00:15:52.480 during paperwork say it
00:15:54.880 the action is in the classroom
00:15:58.079 the action is in the yard
00:16:00.880 the action's in the eating area
00:16:03.920 i have high needs to be with
00:16:06.240 my students and my staff
00:16:09.120 and he has high expectations today until
00:16:11.759 esther castrita mcshane took over as
00:16:14.079 principal euclid was a very low
00:16:16.160 achieving school with little expectation
00:16:18.560 of future improvements
00:16:22.480 esther and her staff are doing what it
00:16:24.320 takes to achieve success at euclid
00:16:26.480 avenue elementary school up to you you
00:16:29.279 are the writers
00:16:31.600 when she came to euclid four years ago
00:16:34.079 esther's first step was to establish a
00:16:36.399 safe environment for the children she
00:16:38.639 fenced in the school grounds and
00:16:40.800 established strict rules of conduct
00:16:43.120 throughout the school first of all let's
00:16:44.800 talk about something do you have a right
00:16:46.399 to get angry yes yes what do you need to
00:16:49.120 do with the person if you're angry with
00:16:51.040 the person
00:16:52.880 tell them not to bother me okay and and
00:16:55.199 does the person have a right to know why
00:16:57.199 not to be bothered
00:16:58.639 so you need to tell the person why is
00:17:00.560 that correct
00:17:01.759 okay sometimes enforcing the rules
00:17:04.559 requires a one-on-one talk with a
00:17:06.720 student one of the things sometimes it
00:17:09.359 requires a session with both the
00:17:11.039 students and the parents
00:17:16.880 francisco
00:17:19.280 i believe that all of us are responsible
00:17:22.559 for our choices
00:17:25.199 and that i have a role and to help
00:17:28.160 people understand the choice that they
00:17:30.960 make in their behavior
00:17:33.919 maintaining order also means maintaining
00:17:36.240 the appearance of order
00:17:38.240 by trying to stay one step ahead of the
00:17:40.160 graffiti that plagues the area for
00:17:41.919 example
00:17:43.200 every weekend
00:17:44.480 local gangs and rival gangs from other
00:17:46.720 neighborhoods leave their mark
00:17:48.880 the graffiti is a constant reminder of
00:17:51.039 the obstacles that euclid avenue
00:17:52.799 students face every day
00:17:56.799 many of the children come to euclid
00:17:58.400 speaking no english at all
00:18:00.960 to cope with the differences in language
00:18:03.120 euclid places a strong emphasis on
00:18:05.360 bilingual education
00:18:08.480 the
00:18:09.440 sole purpose for bilingual education is
00:18:12.559 to acquire english to be literate in
00:18:15.760 english to converse and to compete in
00:18:18.960 the english speaking world
00:18:23.200 in order for
00:18:24.720 someone to learn a second language there
00:18:27.360 has to be a certain level of literacy
00:18:30.400 so that they can transfer
00:18:32.559 understandings
00:18:34.080 concepts to another language
00:18:39.170 
00:18:48.160 the bilingual program here is very
00:18:50.400 successful
00:18:52.080 it's successful because
00:18:54.240 it's a philosophy that has been embraced
00:18:57.039 by all of us
00:19:04.640 i have addressed the issue
00:19:06.960 the the faculty wasn't always united on
00:19:09.679 issues like bilingual education
00:19:12.160 in fact one of the first obstacles that
00:19:14.480 esther mcshane had to overcome on the
00:19:16.400 road to excellence was a divided faculty
00:19:21.520 when esther first came
00:19:23.440 to this school we were
00:19:25.840 in a state of chaos teachers were
00:19:28.720 battling with each other
00:19:30.720 and just totally upset with
00:19:32.400 administration
00:19:36.000 and of course the students were losing
00:19:38.960 out
00:19:39.840 i'm on the up and up test scores were
00:19:42.400 down
00:19:43.679 attitudes were pretty bad
00:19:47.360 and
00:19:48.720 when she first came esther first came in
00:19:51.760 she
00:19:52.799 decided that we needed to bring in the
00:19:54.880 achievement council in order to get some
00:19:57.919 necessary changes done there was racial
00:20:01.039 tension
00:20:02.559 there was
00:20:03.679 tension of teachers that were not
00:20:06.400 talking to each other in the halls
00:20:09.600 there was no focus on looking at kids
00:20:12.720 and achievement there were the teachers
00:20:14.880 that were with the bilingual program and
00:20:17.360 versus the non-bilingual teachers all
00:20:20.080 those things were going on it was a
00:20:21.840 fractured school very fragmented
00:20:24.720 emilia tenoco is head of the local
00:20:26.799 teachers union and a classroom teacher
00:20:29.039 at euclid
00:20:30.880 she was here when esther became
00:20:32.840 principal ms mcshane brought some
00:20:34.799 outside mediators which were part of
00:20:36.320 this achievement council to come to see
00:20:38.559 if maybe we can work this out and what
00:20:40.640 we what the point that we got to was not
00:20:42.880 really
00:20:45.520 having to change over our beliefs but at
00:20:47.280 least respect the other person
00:20:49.520 let me just tell you that they began to
00:20:52.080 experience that it is okay to be
00:20:54.559 different
00:20:55.520 it is okay to have our own beliefs then
00:20:57.840 they were able to go beyond
00:21:00.640 the cultural
00:21:02.480 racial
00:21:04.000 language barriers and they began to
00:21:06.480 communicate
00:21:07.840 about educating children i'm thinking
00:21:11.120 about the other programs too we're only
00:21:13.840 here for one person in that of reason
00:21:16.159 and that is to educate children and i
00:21:18.720 need to provide the climate
00:21:21.280 uh the environment where learning can
00:21:23.679 take place
00:21:26.000 in order to provide that environment
00:21:28.480 esther has focused her attention on the
00:21:30.559 classroom
00:21:32.880 into something else her strategy is to
00:21:35.200 produce successful students by fostering
00:21:38.080 excellent teaching that this is not
00:21:40.880 one
00:21:41.919 what i look for in a classroom is to see
00:21:45.120 time on task
00:21:47.440 why is it that the child is engaged in
00:21:49.919 that activity
00:21:51.440 is that activity
00:21:53.360 challenging that sticks out okay
00:21:56.159 a deer a deer where does it look like a
00:21:58.640 deer point hearts
00:22:01.200 we need to begin to concentrate on what
00:22:03.600 we need to do
00:22:06.159 to upgrade the educational program in
00:22:09.440 every classroom
00:22:11.120 i want them to begin to focus on the
00:22:13.679 thinking aspect of reaching a conclusion
00:22:15.760 of something esther follows up her
00:22:17.360 observation of teacher linda murakami
00:22:19.679 with a formal review
00:22:21.440 whatever let's say this is the picture
00:22:23.679 and that you would show the picture to
00:22:25.200 the entire
00:22:26.480 group and say
00:22:27.840 study this picture and be ready to tell
00:22:30.240 me
00:22:31.120 what animal this is and how do you know
00:22:34.080 it's that animal because they do have
00:22:36.159 the background okay i think what she's
00:22:38.640 really good at is
00:22:41.039 is observing teachers and seeing their
00:22:43.120 strengths and trying to draw from their
00:22:44.799 strengths and getting us to share with
00:22:46.799 each other
00:22:47.919 what did she promise
00:22:50.400 esther encourages teachers to share by
00:22:53.039 providing them with time to observe each
00:22:55.120 other in the classroom
00:22:58.000 afterwards
00:22:59.120 she will meet with the teachers to
00:23:00.480 discuss their observations
00:23:03.760 that's a
00:23:05.200 lifetime skill i think to be an
00:23:07.520 effective administrator you have to be
00:23:10.080 allow them i teach you that and feel
00:23:12.000 good about it this is a large classroom
00:23:14.480 the entire school is a large classroom
00:23:18.240 i have teachers i have children and i
00:23:20.880 have community i have parents
00:23:23.120 what actually is our question one way to
00:23:25.600 involve the community in esther's
00:23:27.280 extended classroom
00:23:29.120 is to conduct educational programs for
00:23:31.520 parents and their children that we
00:23:33.679 haven't even thought of yet try to solve
00:23:36.960 the problem then i'm going to let you
00:23:38.480 work this is a session on problem
00:23:40.720 solving skills
00:23:42.240 programs like these help lay the
00:23:44.000 foundations for success by integrating
00:23:46.880 parents into the life of the
00:23:48.840 school to double that dollar 20 yeah 120
00:23:51.840 and deal with time
00:23:53.200 attaining success also means preventing
00:23:56.080 failure and that means helping children
00:23:58.559 overcome obstacles to learning
00:24:02.840 this needs help in setting and meeting
00:24:04.640 daily goals
00:24:06.720 individual attention is an important
00:24:08.720 part of euclid's program and then every
00:24:11.440 week
00:24:12.720 of teachers and specialists meets to
00:24:15.120 discuss children who are experiencing
00:24:17.360 difficulty in the classroom
00:24:18.720 comprehension
00:24:20.000 vice principal robert cordova chairs
00:24:22.000 these meetings in the movement from
00:24:25.200 from what he has in his head to the
00:24:26.720 paper
00:24:27.679 that's that's the part
00:24:29.440 like overall like when we talk about
00:24:31.679 everything from behavior to completing
00:24:34.640 the task he's not progressing well
00:24:36.640 enough to
00:24:38.400 to
00:24:39.360 be on grade level skills so i feel that
00:24:42.320 he needs help
00:24:44.159 esther has established a safe
00:24:46.080 environment that is conducive to
00:24:47.840 learning
00:24:49.120 she has united the faculty
00:24:51.919 encouraged professional development
00:24:54.960 and involved parents in the life of the
00:24:56.960 school
00:24:58.799 her next challenge is to improve student
00:25:00.960 achievement
00:25:02.080 the most important job of all
00:25:05.039 working together
00:25:06.320 excellent today we're going to use
00:25:09.520 communication
00:25:11.600 we're going to use the system
00:25:13.039 communication
00:25:15.120 as a way of
00:25:16.880 looking at another person's point of
00:25:19.840 view
00:25:22.000 i'm the wolf
00:25:23.760 alexander t
00:25:25.919 wolf
00:25:27.200 to help improve achievement esther has
00:25:29.679 established a bilingual gifted and
00:25:31.600 talented program
00:25:33.679 the real story is about a sneeze
00:25:36.400 and a cup of sugar her plan is that the
00:25:38.400 teaching strategies developed in the
00:25:40.080 program will soon be used throughout the
00:25:42.559 school
00:25:44.240 teacher geraldine allen works with one
00:25:46.080 of these classes
00:25:47.760 i called mr pig mr pig are you in he
00:25:51.520 yelled back go away wolf you can't come
00:25:55.120 in i'm shaving the hair on my chinny
00:25:58.080 chin chin
00:26:01.120 and they made me the big bad wolf
00:26:03.679 that's it the real story
00:26:06.480 i was framed
00:26:08.960 but maybe you could lend me a cup of
00:26:10.559 sugar
00:26:13.440 all right
00:26:15.600 looking at this story
00:26:18.960 whose point of view
00:26:22.480 did we have here
00:26:25.679 the wolf's point of view usually when
00:26:28.240 you hear this story whose point of view
00:26:30.799 do you hear
00:26:32.960 okay
00:26:34.159 the pigs
00:26:35.440 maybe maybe the pig's point of view
00:26:38.480 who
00:26:39.440 the narrator okay another person's point
00:26:42.240 of view i want my children to believe in
00:26:45.039 themselves
00:26:46.480 and to believe that they can accomplish
00:26:49.440 anything they choose to
00:26:52.480 and
00:26:53.279 i realize that my job is to teach them
00:26:56.159 strategies
00:26:57.440 for accomplishing these things
00:27:00.640 group one
00:27:02.400 will create a documentary
00:27:05.200 using the old camcorder allen breaks the
00:27:08.400 class into cooperative groups
00:27:10.799 one will produce a video
00:27:12.799 another a newspaper front page
00:27:15.279 and others will rewrite famous fairy
00:27:17.360 tales and we left the house on garden
00:27:19.760 the purpose
00:27:20.960 to explore different points of view
00:27:23.520 we use a lot of cooperative
00:27:25.760 learning
00:27:27.600 i do depend on the children teaching
00:27:29.679 themselves
00:27:31.120 and with me as the
00:27:33.600 your
00:27:34.399 headline
00:27:36.000 and then you'll have your artist do some
00:27:38.000 conception
00:27:39.760 okay okay then uh you're gonna tell the
00:27:42.240 story because you're the giant
00:27:43.919 okay
00:27:44.799 we're moving
00:27:46.480 it's uh it's a slow move but we're
00:27:49.120 moving it's exactly what the editor
00:27:51.760 thinks
00:27:52.720 it can be
00:27:53.840 with the help of teachers like geraldine
00:27:55.840 allen esther mcshane has put euclid's
00:27:58.399 school on the path to success but if i
00:28:01.200 can make arrangements to reschedule that
00:28:03.520 you think you'll learn it back
00:28:05.200 but there is still a distance to go
00:28:09.600 there won't be a peace of mind until we
00:28:11.200 begin to really upgrade
00:28:13.200 children achievement in this school
00:28:15.360 which means every single staff member
00:28:17.919 needs to be
00:28:19.120 on top of every child that we need to
00:28:21.760 know the child and we need to be sure
00:28:24.080 that we are providing the services that
00:28:26.559 will allow the child to grow to their
00:28:30.320 optimum level
00:28:32.000 every year
00:28:37.570 
00:29:27.480 




00:29:40.720 does our team work
00:29:42.399 do we focus on success
00:29:44.480 are we becoming the best that we can be
00:29:46.880 what is the key to success
00:29:49.720 
00:29:51.679 and the reason why we are doing all of
00:29:53.520 this is because we are
00:29:58.480 the students at thorncliffe community
00:30:00.399 school say they're building their future
00:30:02.880 it's a far cry from the past when
00:30:05.360 thorncliff was one of the most dangerous
00:30:07.360 schools in edmonton alberta kids were
00:30:09.600 just out of control at school there was
00:30:11.440 no consequence that would fit their
00:30:13.440 their action
00:30:14.960 enter lou yanu who was named principal
00:30:17.760 four years ago
00:30:19.679 he brought in some new teachers
00:30:21.760 an entirely new attitude
00:30:24.640 and a new approach
00:30:27.039 this was to be a student-centered school
00:30:30.240 in a student-centered school the belief
00:30:33.279 the generic belief is that every child
00:30:36.640 can succeed
00:30:39.039 and they are succeeding
00:30:41.919 discipline problems are down
00:30:44.159 academic achievement is up
00:30:46.159 and school spirit is off the
00:30:48.840 charts thorncliffe community school
00:30:52.240 has taken off
00:30:56.100 
00:30:57.960 
00:31:16.780 
00:31:17.350 
00:31:20.320 it's a big day at thorncliffe
00:31:23.600 this is a showdown between two floor
00:31:25.600 hockey teams
00:31:27.279 the students against the teachers
00:31:30.640 at stake the kuba saw cup
00:31:35.360 as usual the head cheerleader is
00:31:37.440 thorncliff principal lou yanu
00:31:42.960 right now the 300 thorncliff students
00:31:45.440 are finishing a series of intensive
00:31:47.519 assessment exams
00:31:49.600 which is exactly why this game is being
00:31:52.159 played
00:31:53.600 if we can introduce
00:31:55.679 something that children can enjoy
00:31:58.399 and loosen up in regards to and have a
00:32:00.480 little bit of fun with
00:32:02.159 then it just makes coming to school and
00:32:04.640 going through the assessment period just
00:32:06.880 a little easier for them and in the
00:32:09.360 gymnasium during the time of the cup you
00:32:12.080 can just
00:32:13.200 see it on the faces of the students how
00:32:15.279 much they're enjoying this
00:32:17.840 the students are enjoying it
00:32:20.159 so are the teachers
00:32:21.760 especially when they score the first
00:32:23.760 goal
00:32:25.519 it's the teachers one to nothing more
00:32:28.080 about the game later
00:32:31.200 thorncliffe is a school that's
00:32:32.640 undergoing a radical transformation
00:32:35.760 one that began when lu yanu arrived four
00:32:38.240 years ago what are you doing to mentally
00:32:40.480 prepare them
00:32:41.679 at the time thorncliff was one of the
00:32:44.000 worst schools in edmonton
00:32:46.720 the school sits on the west side of the
00:32:48.640 city
00:32:49.600 in the shadow of the enormous west
00:32:51.440 edmonton mall
00:32:53.440 by u.s standards the surrounding
00:32:55.440 neighborhood might not seem poverty
00:32:57.360 ridden
00:32:58.720 but three-quarters of thorncliffe
00:33:00.399 students are considered low-income
00:33:02.960 and nearly half come from single-parent
00:33:05.200 families
00:33:07.200 this is a troubled neighborhood with one
00:33:09.200 of the highest crime rates in edmonton
00:33:11.760 and many of those troubles were carried
00:33:13.679 over into thorncliff
00:33:15.600 it was a school that in many ways was
00:33:18.480 very dysfunctional teachers were
00:33:21.360 suspending students from the classroom
00:33:25.120 to the tune of over
00:33:26.799 300 a month
00:33:29.039 out of the classroom for being
00:33:30.880 disruptive and out of control
00:33:33.600 while some students were unruly
00:33:36.000 many others were frightened james ross
00:33:39.120 is a sixth grader at thorncliffe
00:33:41.360 he remembers how things were
00:33:43.600 before on the playgrounds there's a lot
00:33:45.440 of violence and fighting all the time
00:33:48.799 and you couldn't go outside without
00:33:50.399 being afraid lou yano's first priority
00:33:53.600 was to eliminate the fear
00:33:56.080 he did away with corporal punishment but
00:33:58.640 set up strict rules for behavior
00:34:02.480 any student breaking those rules is
00:34:04.399 disciplined quickly and fairly you told
00:34:07.039 the boy not to touch your ball what
00:34:08.719 should you have done then besides
00:34:10.239 kicking him
00:34:12.480 that's right now when you told michael
00:34:15.679 not to touch your ball how did you tell
00:34:17.280 them that
00:34:18.239 ted davis presides over daily detention
00:34:21.280 children who have broken a rule spend
00:34:22.960 their recess time here okay
00:34:25.679 you hit somebody
00:34:26.960 you're going to have a recess attention
00:34:28.480 you hit somebody in the
00:34:29.918 in the uh outside the school there's
00:34:31.520 going to be a consequence for that if
00:34:32.719 you hit somebody when you're older and
00:34:34.879 it's in the
00:34:36.000 in a mall or in a in a dark shopping
00:34:38.399 center parking lot there's going to be a
00:34:40.000 consequence for that action and that's
00:34:41.599 what we're trying to get these kids to
00:34:42.639 realize there's a there's a consequence
00:34:44.159 for all their actions good morning boys
00:34:46.159 and girls
00:34:50.480 discipline is also maintained by
00:34:52.560 positive reinforcement
00:34:54.879 this assembly is to award monthly
00:34:57.040 diamond of distinction certificates to
00:34:59.200 students who exhibit exemplary behavior
00:35:02.560 any student who earns a certificate is
00:35:04.560 eligible for a drawing to be held the
00:35:06.560 last day of school
00:35:08.160 the grand prize for the diamond of
00:35:10.400 distinction award will be a brand new 18
00:35:14.400 speed bicycle any idea why you're here
00:35:18.079 um
00:35:19.200 i don't
00:35:20.400 another distinction at thorncliffe is to
00:35:22.320 be called to the principal's office
00:35:24.960 at this school it usually means you did
00:35:27.440 something right
00:35:28.800 for the most part mitch you've made a
00:35:30.800 lot of changes here at the school you
00:35:32.960 put in a lot of great effort and that's
00:35:35.280 why you're here this afternoon
00:35:37.920 i received this let me tell you what a
00:35:39.839 celebration it is for the students when
00:35:42.079 they come down to the office i am very
00:35:45.839 impressed and we have an opportunity to
00:35:49.359 to share the good news with one another
00:35:51.680 and then in each and every case i take
00:35:54.000 it upon myself in the presence of the
00:35:56.079 student to inform the parent or guardian
00:35:59.839 of that child whether they be at home or
00:36:02.720 or at work
00:36:04.000 and it is just a wonderful celebration
00:36:06.880 well that's just great
00:36:09.119 he just loves that school so much and
00:36:11.040 he's done so well since uh he's been
00:36:13.760 going there if it weren't for the
00:36:15.520 teachers and yourself
00:36:17.520 he would not do as well as he does
00:36:20.400 lou yanu also went about transforming
00:36:22.640 the entire school atmosphere
00:36:25.359 thorncliff was to be a place where all
00:36:27.599 children could succeed as part of our
00:36:29.760 belief statement
00:36:31.040 we believe that all students have three
00:36:33.839 generic needs one a need for competency
00:36:37.119 and achievement two a need for structure
00:36:39.359 safety control and discipline and three
00:36:42.000 a need for positive personalized
00:36:43.760 interaction between peers and adults
00:36:46.240 as a staff then if we collectively
00:36:48.560 believe this
00:36:49.839 at our staff meetings we make decisions
00:36:52.480 as to programs activities and events
00:36:55.359 that match that
00:36:57.599 oh wonderful you're doing great can you
00:37:00.079 feel it pulling positive interaction
00:37:02.160 between children and adults
00:37:04.320 it's evident in the classroom and on the
00:37:06.480 playground
00:37:08.240 lujanu does whatever it takes to make
00:37:10.640 thorncliff as enjoyable as possible
00:37:13.839 his enthusiasm is obvious
00:37:16.160 it's also highly contagious
00:37:19.280 but discipline and an inviting
00:37:21.119 atmosphere our only means to an end
00:37:23.839 the primary mission of thorncliffe is
00:37:26.000 education
00:37:28.480 if children enjoy coming to school
00:37:30.240 there's no question
00:37:31.680 they will learn
00:37:33.119 if children do not enjoy coming to
00:37:35.280 school and in fact hate being in class
00:37:39.520 regardless of how tight your curriculum
00:37:41.839 is they will learn less than they are
00:37:44.400 capable of so the teaching learning
00:37:47.280 process must be interesting it also must
00:37:50.480 be inviting
00:37:51.920 and fun
00:37:52.960 every facial thing has a feeling all of
00:37:55.280 a sudden your team's down there you're
00:37:56.800 down two to four casey's coming to bat
00:37:58.800 also you see
00:38:00.000 tons of people getting up to leave fifth
00:38:02.400 grade teacher ben nathanson has taken
00:38:04.720 that idea of combining fun and learning
00:38:07.599 and turned it into an art form are you
00:38:09.839 mad yeah well show me mad
00:38:14.079 your best friend's getting up to leave
00:38:16.640 you paid for him to get in

00:38:38.560 unbelievable i believe in what i do

00:38:47.920 learn something they challenge me and i
00:38:50.400 accept that challenge and all i ask for
00:38:52.560 is effort but if i'm not going to come
00:38:53.920 with the enthusiasm
00:38:55.440 they're not going to learn anything so
00:38:57.359 it's my personality to take the humor
00:38:59.280 and look for the humor in somebody and
00:39:01.280 draw it out of them did you change your
00:39:03.119 expression ben nathanson doesn't simply
00:39:05.440 have his students read out loud
00:39:07.920 they take this poem search for the
00:39:10.000 emotional elements then act them out
00:39:13.359 casey's coming look here he comes look
00:39:15.359 at him yeah yeah that's expression folks
00:39:18.240 not
00:39:19.359 i want them to get excited about reading
00:39:21.200 words are fun words can do things to you
00:39:23.520 if you use a little drama with it
00:39:25.839 if you use expressions and make them
00:39:27.680 feel it when they go to their desk you
00:39:29.680 got them started you got a fire built in
00:39:31.760 them casey's coming to back you've got a
00:39:33.760 chance to win all right dj's jumping up
00:39:36.320 for joy they're going counting his money
00:39:38.000 man i got money on this game and you
00:39:40.480 challenge them i'm challenging those
00:39:42.240 kids to find a different way to do it
00:39:44.000 right so you've got to believe what
00:39:45.599 you're pretending to see what are you
00:39:47.520 pretending to see casey's coming show me
00:39:49.760 casey and then they pick apart the story
00:39:52.079 slowly and they see it differently
00:39:53.760 that's exciting for a child versus
00:39:55.680 here's the book read it answer the
00:39:56.960 questions
00:39:58.079 that's not exciting
00:39:59.300 
00:40:00.720 things are exciting back at the hockey
00:40:02.720 game the students have a penalty shot
00:40:04.960 
00:40:07.359 the contest for the kubasaw cup is tied
00:40:10.400 teachers won students won
00:40:13.599 okay how was this story how was her
00:40:15.760 story different from the original fairy
00:40:17.599 tale this is another school-wide
00:40:19.680 activity something called shared reading
00:40:23.119 each week students gather in small
00:40:25.040 groups to read stories they've written
00:40:27.280 launches to aid us in the battle we only
00:40:29.920 have 20 warriors
00:40:32.079 when holly got there she obviously it is
00:40:34.800 a very academic directed program the
00:40:38.079 opportunity for children to engage in
00:40:41.119 quality writing skills
00:40:42.980 
00:40:44.480 but also there is a social component to
00:40:47.200 it as well the children then have the
00:40:49.280 opportunity to meet with all
00:40:53.200 grade levels in the school and share
00:40:55.359 their writing and so it goes back to the
00:40:58.400 idea that academics and behavior can fit
00:41:01.760 very well together
00:41:03.520 yes
00:41:04.839 thorncliffe good behavior goes hand in
00:41:07.440 hand with academic success
00:41:10.160 and if a student isn't succeeding
00:41:12.400 there's plenty of extra support
00:41:13.920 available you go ahead and try and
00:41:15.440 distract them
00:41:17.280 pat castoros teaches a skills class if
00:41:20.560 students are disruptive or have trouble
00:41:22.640 paying attention they come here for one
00:41:25.200 period to learn some basic interpersonal
00:41:27.680 skills yeah
00:41:30.000 keep trying be real persistent corey
00:41:34.400 yesley
00:41:35.760 cory keeps poking his pencil and
00:41:38.400 distracting me oh no so how does that
00:41:40.800 make you feel
00:41:42.000 sad sad
00:41:43.760 and mad
00:41:44.960 well you've done a good job by telling
00:41:46.720 us what's going on instead of just
00:41:48.480 poking them back right
00:41:50.480 the skills class has a single purpose to
00:41:53.280 get these students ready and able to
00:41:55.280 learn back of the guy pushing them back
00:41:57.760 and forth if they are able to have some
00:42:00.319 self-control and
00:42:02.480 manage their behavior within a classroom
00:42:04.560 and
00:42:05.359 listen to the teacher then they're
00:42:06.640 picking up on the lessons that the
00:42:08.000 teachers trying to teach them
00:42:09.680 that in turn helps their academic skills
00:42:12.000 which in turn
00:42:13.280 later in life can can benefit them in
00:42:15.680 the workplace
00:42:17.599 thorncliffe teachers talk often about
00:42:19.599 preparing their students for later life
00:42:22.319 so when ted davis has his fourth graders
00:42:24.560 read a story they do it in small groups
00:42:28.240 the focus isn't on just reading
00:42:30.720 but also on cooperation
00:42:34.640 they come into my classroom we have to
00:42:36.160 cooperate with each other we're a team
00:42:38.160 we work together we're a group what
00:42:40.000 we're trying to do at this school is
00:42:41.040 prepare them for
00:42:42.319 for once they get out of this school and
00:42:45.520 no matter where they go in their life
00:42:46.800 they're going to have to cooperate with
00:42:48.000 somebody whether it's standing in a
00:42:49.200 bread line or applying for a job and the
00:42:52.560 idea of teamwork is is very very
00:42:54.640 important
00:42:55.599 eight times six
00:42:59.280 okay team three gets this is another
00:43:01.839 effort to make learning as engaging as
00:43:03.920 possible
00:43:05.040 when it's time to work on math ted davis
00:43:07.680 breaks his class into teams
00:43:10.319 my class was weak in the multiplication
00:43:11.920 facts
00:43:13.119 so i try and bring in these little games
00:43:14.560 like the multiplication relay where they
00:43:16.000 go up to the board they have fun with it
00:43:18.160 make it a bit more incentive
00:43:20.560 and
00:43:21.680 eight times eight again the team effort
00:43:23.920 you work together
00:43:28.000 meanwhile the student hockey team works
00:43:30.480 together to break the tie
00:43:34.160 with time running out the students hold
00:43:36.400 a two to one lead over the teachers
00:43:40.160 nine
00:43:41.359 planes
00:43:43.280 three
00:43:44.319 planes fly
00:43:46.960 away
00:43:48.720 nine
00:43:49.920 take away three
00:43:51.839 yeah
00:43:54.460 
00:43:58.400 there's a concentrated effort at
00:44:00.000 thorncliffe to improve self-esteem
00:44:02.800 an effort that begins on the first day
00:44:04.800 of school
00:44:06.319 joanne moulter wants her first graders
00:44:08.400 to experience success very early
00:44:11.680 even a simple success like solving a
00:44:14.000 math problem
00:44:16.800 can you look at the picture or use your
00:44:18.319 fingers
00:44:23.600 
00:44:26.960 keep going looks good
00:44:29.119 before you can teach you have to have
00:44:30.800 the kids feeling good about themselves i
00:44:32.319 think they go in hand i don't think you
00:44:33.760 can have
00:44:34.800 the academics just academic the kids are
00:44:37.200 not going to be motivated to learn
00:44:39.050 
00:44:42.079 they have to feel good about themselves
00:44:43.760 and when they do that then you can teach
00:44:46.000 them then they will learn and achieve
00:44:48.560 the emperor's new clothes by hans
00:44:50.400 kristen anderson self-esteem is also
00:44:53.280 enhanced by support from other students
00:44:55.760 in pauline drinkwater's class second
00:44:58.240 graders read a story and make analogies
00:45:01.040 between themselves and the main
00:45:02.640 character
00:45:05.020 
00:45:07.440 the rest of the class is then invited to
00:45:09.359 make comments the emphasis is on the
00:45:11.920 positive i am
00:45:14.160 i am do agree that
00:45:16.160 you aren't as
00:45:18.640 as foolish as i can
00:45:21.680 erin
00:45:22.960 um evan i agree with you that you don't
00:45:25.760 wear royal clothing he does
00:45:28.000 okay thanks for sharing that one
00:45:32.000 half a dozen cookies cost two dollars 70
00:45:34.960 cents what is the cost of one well the
00:45:37.119 information if we look at it like this
00:45:41.359 you have half a dozen cookies that
00:45:43.280 represents half a dozen cookies right
00:45:46.079 you are correct is that the only
00:45:47.680 information you need to solve the
00:45:48.720 problem
00:45:50.079 the focus on self-esteem continues in
00:45:52.480 the later grades
00:45:54.480 ben nathanson is teaching his fifth
00:45:56.160 graders how to solve math problems
00:45:58.560 right now we know that half a dozen
00:46:00.640 cookies cost 270. but most of the
00:46:03.200 knowledge is produced by the students
00:46:05.040 themselves is he missing one more thing
00:46:07.119 in that problem
00:46:09.680 is there anything else in the
00:46:10.560 mathematical problem you need to draw
00:46:15.680 give them the sheet so you can read the
00:46:16.880 problem quickly are you sure ray that's
00:46:18.960 the only thing you need
00:46:21.440 hands if you know there's something
00:46:22.560 missing
00:46:24.560 just one person
00:46:26.400 holly's not sure she's halfway down now
00:46:28.560 she's positive she's guessing mr
00:46:30.319 robinson looks confident
00:46:32.480 mr paquette you don't look so confident
00:46:36.720 are you happy with it yeah ask your
00:46:38.400 partner if he's happy with it
00:46:40.400 yeah okay so elevator down
00:46:43.040 you're not happy with it
00:46:46.319 no step one we're still step one
00:46:49.440 mr robinson um it
00:46:52.079 doesn't tell you that you have to find
00:46:54.000 out
00:46:54.720 what the price of one cookie is so
00:46:57.920 should you not draw an arrow draw one
00:47:00.079 and say cost
00:47:01.839 question mark
00:47:03.280 like what are we supposed to find out as
00:47:04.560 far as you're concerned
00:47:06.160 we got the answer right here two dollars
00:47:08.400 70 cents half a dozen
00:47:10.160 what a waste of time
00:47:11.920 because all this information is not
00:47:13.359 leading back to here
00:47:15.680 so could you have drawn that
00:47:17.760 yeah how many did how many took it that
00:47:19.839 extra step
00:47:21.119 how many did not how many have
00:47:22.839 this if you took it one more step i vow
00:47:26.000 to you congratulations you took it an
00:47:28.160 extra step you thought this much more
00:47:30.960 don't get us wrong here with our
00:47:32.240 philosophy about self-esteem just leave
00:47:34.319 it like that
00:47:35.359 academics is important to us
00:47:37.599 i think if you check our records i think
00:47:39.440 you'll see the academic standing of a
00:47:41.200 lot of these kids and i think we can
00:47:43.440 stand tall with our heads up saying
00:47:45.440 we're not just touchy feely we're not
00:47:47.520 into that we're into the human being and
00:47:49.839 doing the best that they possibly can do
00:47:51.920 and academics is very important to us at
00:47:54.319 this school but self-worth self-esteem
00:47:57.680 starts it all off
00:47:59.200 the reason that we're getting together
00:48:01.760 is to make our community a graffiti free
00:48:05.920 community there's a major effort at
00:48:08.079 thorncliffe to connect students with the
00:48:10.079 world outside of school
00:48:12.160 donna granger's class wants to get rid
00:48:14.079 of graffiti in edmonton graffiti isn't
00:48:17.359 just what it says in the dictionary
00:48:19.359 graffiti is
00:48:21.359 all about feelings
00:48:24.640 and stop and think for a moment
00:48:27.520 all right let's start over here one of
00:48:29.520 your feelings was
00:48:31.760 embarrassed
00:48:33.040 just feel sorry for him or her sorry
00:48:36.720 we feel embarrassed we feel sorry
00:48:39.040 and your group please you feel scared
00:48:41.280 thank you these students don't just talk
00:48:43.440 about graffiti mad they try to do
00:48:46.160 something about it that includes making
00:48:49.280 a phone call to city hall
00:48:51.920 what has to be
00:48:53.760 um
00:48:55.200 the graffiti
00:48:57.200 all right let's help them
00:49:01.740 
00:49:06.400 this is another learning activity that
00:49:08.400 takes place out of the classroom
00:49:10.800 the corn cliff rocket club is putting on
00:49:12.960 a show
00:49:19.160 
00:49:21.920 the rocket club was the idea of school
00:49:24.160 counselor pat fizzell
00:49:26.400 the idea that we put children
00:49:29.119 in a little box called school and we
00:49:31.200 invest their childhood there
00:49:33.280 i don't believe has been overly
00:49:34.640 successful
00:49:35.920 at dawn cliff school we invest child
00:49:38.480 children in the daily act of living in
00:49:40.880 the daily act of making their world a
00:49:42.960 little bit better
00:49:44.720 things are going a little bit better for
00:49:46.559 the teachers
00:49:47.839 they score to even the hockey game at
00:49:49.920 two goals apiece
00:49:53.650 
00:49:57.119 this big match will be decided by a
00:49:59.520 shootout
00:50:01.280 i'm asking you to begin to read
00:50:03.520 on your own and take some responsibility
00:50:05.359 for this for yourself okay i don't want
00:50:07.599 you to be dependent on me
00:50:09.440 these are well within your reading
00:50:11.119 levels and i'm expecting you
00:50:13.839 to work on them to get started while the
00:50:16.640 general belief at thorncliffe is that
00:50:18.400 all students can succeed
00:50:20.319 there's support for children who are
00:50:21.920 having difficulty i'm expecting you to
00:50:24.079 take the responsibility of reading this
00:50:25.520 yourself right now okay great thanks
00:50:27.760 very much how to be brian ferguson
00:50:29.920 teaches a group of students with
00:50:31.359 emotional and behavioral problems
00:50:34.160 the idea is to eventually get these kids
00:50:36.720 back into a regular classroom i see work
00:50:39.280 in the meantime
00:50:40.480 they're taught the regular curriculum
00:50:42.640 and offered as much attention and
00:50:44.400 encouragement as possible nice job guys
00:50:47.599 okay newbie
00:50:49.119 really in there with me and a real
00:50:50.800 contributor today and i really
00:50:52.240 appreciate that thanks very much leo
00:50:55.040 nice job right in there like a bear way
00:50:57.040 to go how to be
00:50:58.800 so let's go to page nine
00:51:01.760 and you read all over on how they look
00:51:04.480 one more special class is made up of
00:51:06.559 children who have fallen at least two
00:51:08.400 years behind their classmates i guess i
00:51:10.720 would describe them as i have a family
00:51:12.400 of 11 children they
00:51:14.640 um
00:51:15.520 range in age from 9 to 13.
00:51:18.559 do you know what a high monica ullman
00:51:20.400 teaches the class again the goal is to
00:51:23.359 have these students catch up and move on
00:51:27.040 they come feeling very left out
00:51:30.960 some of them actually come with quite a
00:51:33.119 chip on their shoulder saying things
00:51:35.119 like i'm stupid
00:51:37.040 end of story they believe that and they
00:51:39.839 would repeat that quite often at the
00:51:41.440 beginning of the year yes he used to
00:51:43.200 live in europe my philosophy as a
00:51:45.119 teacher is
00:51:46.720 whether it's with special needs students
00:51:48.720 or with regular students is that
00:51:51.359 all children can have successes if
00:51:54.880 the
00:51:56.480 situation is set up very carefully at
00:51:59.119 the beginning so that those successes
00:52:01.280 are very meaningful to them
00:52:03.440 there's a continual effort at
00:52:04.960 thorncliffe to monitor all students
00:52:07.520 an effort that goes beyond the usual
00:52:09.440 standardized tests
00:52:11.599 the school has developed its own
00:52:13.119 assessment program in which each child
00:52:15.440 is tested at the beginning of the school
00:52:17.280 year and again at the end of the year
00:52:20.640 we are
00:52:21.839 more interested in individual growth
00:52:25.440 for students over the course of the year
00:52:28.480 than comparing them to other learning
00:52:31.119 groups either in the city or in the
00:52:33.839 province
00:52:35.040 we are able to do that by identifying
00:52:38.480 the change that takes place between
00:52:40.960 their achievement level at the beginning
00:52:43.599 of the year and at the end of the year
00:52:46.000 the classic pre and post-test assessment
00:52:48.480 profile
00:52:49.920 if testing shows a child is falling
00:52:51.920 behind
00:52:52.960 teachers at thorncliffe search for new
00:52:55.040 and different strategies
00:52:57.200 all around the school there were
00:52:58.559 reminders to the staff
00:53:00.480 they're expected to do anything it takes
00:53:02.880 to reach every child it's a team effort
00:53:06.000 i will not say to the child you did not
00:53:08.240 succeed it's we did not succeed and that
00:53:10.880 includes the parent it's a triangle and
00:53:12.720 the kid has to know it's a triangle and
00:53:14.800 it's it's the school the teacher the
00:53:17.119 parent and the child and we truly
00:53:18.960 believe that here at thorncliffe if a
00:53:21.520 child in the in the classroom is having
00:53:23.520 difficulty learning the teachers have
00:53:25.920 committed themselves to working with
00:53:27.920 that child certainly within the
00:53:29.760 classroom but outside the classroom as
00:53:32.319 well as networking with the parents to
00:53:34.960 ensure that that child will succeed
00:53:39.520 parents have played a critical role in
00:53:41.440 thorncliffe's transformation
00:53:43.440 whether it's tutoring children or
00:53:45.359 monitoring the playground
00:53:48.160 25 minutes
00:53:49.680 after scene after six we have another
00:53:52.079 bingo coming up on tuesday and we were
00:53:54.480 wondering if you'd be able to work it
00:53:56.240 cheryl rose is president of the parental
00:53:58.400 advisory council
00:54:00.079 which has more than a hundred members
00:54:03.200 once a month the council runs a bingo
00:54:05.280 game at the west edmonton mall
00:54:09.280 they raise enough money to pay for most
00:54:11.359 of the school's field trips
00:54:14.160 we have a tendency to find out that
00:54:15.599 budgets have been cut and the
00:54:18.000 schools don't don't always have enough
00:54:19.839 funding to do exactly what they want to
00:54:21.680 do
00:54:22.400 and whatever they've decided to do which
00:54:24.400 isn't saying that it isn't enough for
00:54:26.000 the kids but we just like to give that
00:54:27.680 little extra so that you know the kids
00:54:29.920 get the best that they can possibly get
00:54:32.640 ladies and gentlemen here we go
00:54:34.480 good luck ray
00:54:37.599 back at the hockey game the shootout is
00:54:40.000 nearly over he's going to shoot
00:54:43.280 eventually
00:54:48.240 the students score to go ahead by one
00:54:51.200 the teachers are down to their last
00:54:53.040 chance i don't believe it i don't
00:54:55.119 believe it
00:54:57.359 here we go
00:55:00.240 if they miss this shot the game is over
00:55:08.079 the students win the game and the famous
00:55:11.119 kuba saw cup
00:55:12.960 at least until next year
00:55:16.559 lou yanu has accomplished his initial
00:55:18.720 goal he's changed the environment of an
00:55:21.760 entire school
00:55:23.359 and the attitude of an entire student
00:55:25.760 body
00:55:26.780 
00:55:43.520 we thought
00:55:44.940 
00:55:56.720 our team works and does its best
00:55:59.920 we have terrific students here fantastic
00:56:04.000 teachers
00:56:05.060 
00:56:13.559 principals and voices
00:56:16.340 
00:56:28.480 can i know what i'm doing thorncliff
00:56:30.160 community school has become a haven a
00:56:33.040 place to enjoy
00:56:34.640 and a place to learn
00:56:36.640 once a school has the base foundation of
00:56:40.720 strong solid supportive discipline as
00:56:44.319 well as a vibrant spirited inviting
00:56:47.760 culture in climate
00:56:49.839 academics
00:56:51.280 hard
00:56:52.640 well fine-tuned academics can
00:56:56.960 be brought into a school with much more
00:57:00.799 enthusiasm
00:57:02.240 with the base foundation in place
00:57:04.400 teachers are more empowered and
00:57:06.000 enthusiastic
00:57:07.599 and find the energy
00:57:09.440 to engage in curriculum development and
00:57:12.400 redevelopment across the top of your

00:57:19.920 entire school
00:57:22.000 but he says he's done just one thing
00:57:24.640 assemble an all-star team of teachers
00:57:27.599 the role of the coach like a hockey
00:57:29.920 coach is to bring the highest quality of
00:57:32.960 players to play on that team and the
00:57:35.680 thorncliffe team has players that are of
00:57:38.640 a quality that could go out on at any
00:57:41.119 one given moment and win the stanley cup
