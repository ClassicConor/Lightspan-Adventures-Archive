00:00:38.399 when you get up in the morning and look
00:00:40.680 in the mirror you see your eyes mouth
00:00:42.680 teeth hair ears and nose your muscles
00:00:45.440 and Bones give you a real good place for
00:00:48.160 you to wear your clothes you got your
00:00:51.160 lungs and stomach and brain and heart
00:00:53.719 and what we think and feels a very
00:00:55.719 important part of how we're put together
00:00:58.519 why we do what we do I look like me and
00:01:01.559 you look like you it's a bunch of need
00:01:04.199 stuff it's fun to know watch listen and
00:01:07.280 learn
00:01:24.280 with okay everybody hold still
00:01:28.600 smile uh wait a minute something's
00:01:31.200 missing everybody's here no that's not
00:01:34.159 what I mean Arnell something else is
00:01:35.960 missing something in Jody's mouth did
00:01:38.720 you lose something yesterday oh my too
00:01:41.880 what happened to it it just fell out wow
00:01:44.640 that's kind of neat it looks like you've
00:01:46.799 lost more than one though yes I've lost
00:01:50.040 other
00:01:50.880 ones yeah I lost one too you have arell
00:01:54.799 eight of them Wow have you lost any
00:01:57.439 teeth recently well why do we lose our
00:02:00.399 baby teeth that's a very good question
00:02:02.399 Tiffany maybe that's why today's a good
00:02:04.680 day to think about our
00:02:07.599 teeth you probably know that your first
00:02:10.160 set of teeth don't last very long we
00:02:13.040 sometimes call them your baby teeth
00:02:15.400 somewhere around the age of five or six
00:02:17.599 or seven you begin to lose your baby
00:02:19.680 teeth one at a time that's good because
00:02:22.760 they're being pushed out by new bigger
00:02:24.920 stronger teeth we call those new teeth
00:02:27.360 your permanent teeth or your adult teeth
00:02:30.879 I can show you why that happens this is
00:02:33.640 a model of baby teeth now jod can
00:02:36.519 already see that these teeth are loose
00:02:39.120 and they're coming out but what she
00:02:40.599 cannot see is what's happening behind
00:02:42.159 this pink skin that we call the gums
00:02:45.080 behind that there's another row of teeth
00:02:48.080 these are the baby teeth and below and
00:02:50.840 above them are the permanent teeth now
00:02:52.800 let's just look at the top row here are
00:02:55.239 the baby teeth and here are the
00:02:57.879 permanent teeth now they're pretty small
00:02:59.440 right now but as they grow and get
00:03:01.480 bigger they push the baby teeth out So
00:03:04.599 eventually one by one all the baby teeth
00:03:07.080 are replaced
00:03:08.959 with a set of permanent teeth and these
00:03:11.959 are called permanent teeth because if
00:03:13.640 you take care of them you have them for
00:03:15.000 the rest of your
00:03:16.120 life Bob arell what Jody's permanent
00:03:19.760 teeth have already grown in already
00:03:22.720 uh-huh
00:03:24.120 look whoa boy you must have a hard time
00:03:27.680 brushing those teeth
00:03:30.239 yeah you Wise Guys somehow I feel that
00:03:33.760 those were not really Jody's permanent
00:03:35.799 teeth but it did get me thinking do you
00:03:38.200 brush your teeth I'm sure people have
00:03:40.239 told you that if you don't brush your
00:03:41.519 teeth you're going to get cavities but
00:03:43.120 have you ever wondered what makes
00:03:44.720 cavities you might be surprised let me
00:03:47.360 show
00:03:47.660 [Music]
00:03:48.840 you have you ever heard the word acid
00:03:52.439 this is how you spell it a c i d acid
00:03:56.599 now do you know what acids are well
00:03:58.400 there are lots of different kinds of
00:03:59.760 acids but some of them can actually eat
00:04:02.239 away or burn other materials let me show
00:04:04.879 you what a little bit of acid can do
00:04:07.159 this is a piece of limestone and
00:04:09.879 it's very hard material and this is a
00:04:13.799 very powerful acid in fact this acid is
00:04:16.600 so strong that I have to protect my skin
00:04:19.040 so I have to wear some gloves so that it
00:04:21.199 won't get on my skin this acid is
00:04:23.440 stronger than any acid you'd have at
00:04:25.040 home in your school so you'd never do
00:04:26.960 this kind of experiment yourself I also
00:04:29.120 have to pret prot my eyes because I
00:04:31.039 don't want any of this acid to Splash
00:04:32.720 into my face now watch what happens when
00:04:35.919 I just take a few drops in this eye
00:04:38.520 dropper of this acid and put it on the
00:04:41.440 Limestone so we'll just get a few drops
00:04:43.800 drawn up in
00:04:45.600 here
00:04:47.280 and watch what they
00:04:53.759 do and look at how that acid eats away
00:04:58.600 at that very hard
00:05:01.320 Limestone it's also turning it
00:05:04.960 brown and if I was to keep doing that
00:05:08.240 eventually that acid would eat right
00:05:10.120 through that piece of limestone here's a
00:05:11.919 piece that we put some acid on earlier
00:05:14.080 and you can see how it's eaten it away
00:05:15.840 it turned it really Brown like that and
00:05:17.639 there's a big depression here and see
00:05:19.680 there it's almost all the way through
00:05:22.120 that very hard stuff this is Stone and
00:05:24.560 the acid ate its way right through it
00:05:27.080 well your teeth the covering on the
00:05:29.800 outside of your teeth the white part is
00:05:32.000 very hard material in fact it's the
00:05:34.120 hardest material in your body and you
00:05:36.080 want to take care of that so that you'll
00:05:37.680 have your teeth for the rest of your
00:05:39.120 life but
00:05:40.960 cavities are holes in that hard outer
00:05:43.680 covering here's one here and there's
00:05:45.759 another one there and you can see how
00:05:47.120 they're brown and they've gone right
00:05:49.600 through that hard covering now what can
00:05:51.840 make those holes and the covering of
00:05:53.520 your teeth well you've probably already
00:05:55.520 guessed acids you have acids in your
00:05:58.080 mouth and they eat away way at your
00:06:00.160 teeth and make holes in them now you're
00:06:02.000 probably saying to yourself wait a
00:06:03.080 minute I don't eat acid I mean I eat
00:06:05.639 fruits I eat vegetables I eat yogurt I
00:06:07.919 eat meat I wouldn't put a a dangerous
00:06:10.520 chemical like that in my mouth and you
00:06:12.080 never should put a chemical like that in
00:06:13.759 your mouth because it is very dangerous
00:06:15.759 so how do you get cavities well
00:06:18.680 something happens to the food that you
00:06:20.440 put in your mouth after you chew your
00:06:23.440 food you swallow most of it but some
00:06:26.080 food is always left in your mouth along
00:06:28.319 the gums and in the spaces between your
00:06:30.479 teeth a lot of food has sugar in it when
00:06:33.599 it mixes with the liquids in your mouth
00:06:35.800 it turns
00:06:37.120 into
00:06:38.840 acid and that acid can start to make
00:06:41.440 tiny holes in your teeth and before you
00:06:43.919 know it ouch you have
00:06:47.759 cavities so sugary food left in your
00:06:50.840 mouth turns into acid so if you don't
00:06:53.240 want cavities you have to clean that
00:06:55.160 food away and it looks like Tiffany has
00:06:58.639 the best way to do that that brush your
00:07:00.440 teeth exactly and how often should you
00:07:02.759 brush your teeth Tiffany after every
00:07:04.960 meal and before you go to bed right now
00:07:07.879 brushing your teeth is important but so
00:07:09.960 is how you brush your teeth Tiffany
00:07:12.120 would you like to show us how to do that
00:07:13.919 okay I'll be the mouth you should always

00:07:37.479 gums it helps to keep them healthy

00:07:42.960 brush your teeth like that after every
00:07:45.039 meal and before you go to bed you will

00:10:51.000 cavities two cavities am I getting my
00:10:55.519 point across you really also have to
00:10:58.320 floss it's a a shame but you have two
00:11:02.920 cavities
00:11:05.160 Force just FL and you will see a great
00:11:09.160 big smile in the denises I found no CES
00:11:13.279 now you floss in the front and you floss
00:11:16.720 in the back the denst got her point
00:11:21.680 across and I haven't had a cavity in two
00:11:26.200 whole
00:11:27.959 years
00:11:29.959 so she hasn't had a c in two whole
00:11:36.200 [Music]
00:11:36.940 [Applause]
00:11:41.360 years because I know how
00:11:44.920 [Music]
00:11:51.720 to so brushing and flossing and getting
00:11:55.519 a regular checkup all of these keep your
00:11:57.600 teeth clean on the outside
00:11:59.600 but you can also keep your teeth healthy
00:12:01.320 and strong from the inside right Arnell
00:12:04.639 hi do you know which food is best for
00:12:06.560 your teeth let's see what drink is best
00:12:10.160 for your teeth soda milk or orange juice
00:12:15.480 you have 5
00:12:22.160 seconds but time's up what did you pick
00:12:26.760 the answer is milk
00:12:29.480 anything made out of milk makes your
00:12:31.959 teeth strong and healthy remember that
00:12:34.920 now which one of these Foods is good for
00:12:37.440 your
00:12:39.000 teeth candy bread or cheese the candy
00:12:44.279 thing we can get rid of right away cuz
00:12:46.839 everybody knows candy is not good for
00:12:49.440 your
00:12:50.240 teeth so bread or
00:12:53.680 cheese you have 5
00:12:57.839 Seconds
00:13:02.680 but time's up the correct answer is
00:13:06.440 cheese did you get that I told you that
00:13:09.800 anything that was made from milk was
00:13:11.480 good for your teeth and cheese is made
00:13:14.519 from milk one more which one of these is
00:13:19.279 good for your
00:13:20.800 teeth buttermilk or
00:13:23.639 yogurt warning this is a trick
00:13:27.279 question you have 5
00:13:32.560 seconds but time's up the answer
00:13:37.120 is both of them all right your baby
00:13:42.399 teeth are soon replaced by permanent
00:13:44.920 teeth the covering on your teeth is the
00:13:47.240 hardest part of your body but sugar and
00:13:50.199 food left in your teeth turns into acid
00:13:53.079 and causes
00:13:55.639 cavities the best way to get rid of that
00:13:57.800 food is to brush
00:13:59.279 after every meal and before bed and to
00:14:02.519 clean the spaces between your teeth you
00:14:04.560 should floss every
00:14:06.560 day a checkup every 6 months will keep
00:14:09.639 your teeth clean and healthy and you'll
00:14:12.040 catch any small cavities before they
00:14:14.000 turn into big ones to strengthen your
00:14:16.920 teeth from the inside drink milk and eat
00:14:19.680 cheese and
00:14:21.839 yogurt boy isn't it great that a
00:14:24.279 delicious tasting food like ice cream is
00:14:26.120 also good for you good for your teeth
00:14:28.920 because it's made with milk what do you
00:14:31.040 think about all this Arnell I say this
00:14:33.320 is something you can sink your teeth
00:14:35.440 into right now wait a minute before you

00:17:51.320 think I got some oh there's a game of
00:17:52.440 cards Checkers Checkers that's something
00:17:54.600 that I like to play you know I like to
00:17:55.840 play games I like to play games like
00:17:57.720 checkers and here's another one that I'm
00:17:59.600 I'm still learning I'm not very good at
00:18:01.080 this one this one's called the the ball
00:18:02.960 in a cup you have to try to get the ball
00:18:04.799 to to stay in the cup like that except
00:18:06.520 you can't put it there with your hand
00:18:07.679 you have to have to do it like this
00:18:12.280 watch oh almost had it yeah I'm not very
00:18:15.320 good at that I'm still trying to learn
00:18:16.600 it maybe you like to make up some gains
00:18:19.200 by yourself or maybe you like to play
00:18:24.240 one of these things H I know Arnell
00:18:26.240 likes to play computer games
00:18:29.320 yeah they're a lot of fun but isn't
00:18:31.360 there a big difference between this
00:18:32.840 computer game and this rattle you didn't
00:18:36.200 play computer games when you were a baby
00:18:38.440 now you can because you're bigger and
00:18:40.039 you're
00:18:40.919 smarter this is Berkley she's a cat my
00:18:45.240 mom said I could have a cat only if I
00:18:48.039 took care of her myself so that means I
00:18:50.880 got to feed brookley make sure she gets
00:18:53.520 water clean out her box that's my job I
00:18:57.640 did it everything say say hi Brickley hi
00:19:01.840 everybody I'm surprised that I take such
00:19:04.559 good care of
00:19:07.760 Brickley I draw pictures mostly with my
00:19:10.600 crayons or chalk but for my birthday I
00:19:13.200 got a bunch of marks and this is what I
00:19:15.159 did with them I'm very proud that I made
00:19:18.080 this picture because this is some place
00:19:20.039 that I made up it has three sons and
00:19:24.320 people with green
00:19:25.919 hair oh and you can see that ping pong
00:19:28.960 balls grow out the
00:19:31.240 trees even though this is a madeup place
00:19:34.039 I would still like to go here
00:19:36.840 someday I do gymnastics I used to just
00:19:39.840 do it myself like doing cartwheels in
00:19:42.360 the park but now I go to gymnastics
00:19:45.039 class we're learning tumbling and
00:19:47.240 handstand and my favorite thing which is
00:19:49.360 sort of like dancing and tumbling at the
00:19:51.679 same
00:19:52.840 time oh and we had a gymnastics meet and
00:19:56.240 I was in it and I got a rib
00:20:01.240 I'm proud that I can do
00:20:04.210 [Music]
00:20:08.280 gymnastics yeah drawing taking care of a
00:20:11.840 pet gymnastics these are all things that
00:20:14.200 you can do
00:20:15.200 now ah almost had it and you're learning
00:20:18.360 to do new things every day so you can do
00:20:21.039 a lot in fact if we were to make a list
00:20:23.080 of all of the things that you can do it
00:20:25.000 would probably be quite long let's watch
00:20:30.600 when I was a baby I didn't do much
00:20:33.280 except eat and sleep and
00:20:35.799 cry now that I'm older I do lots of
00:20:39.080 things did you know that I can I can
00:20:46.320 whistle a tune draw a
00:20:49.480 cartoon look at the Moon and use a spoon
00:20:54.320 and maybe somay soon a light a
00:21:00.919 balloon I can turn out the light read
00:21:05.320 and right be polite and stay overnight
00:21:10.400 and tomorrow I just might go fly K I can
00:21:17.320 I can I can I
00:21:22.559 can I can I can I
00:21:28.559 can I
00:21:31.600 can I can take a hike ride my bike hit a
00:21:38.640 ball stand real tall tie my shoes pick
00:21:44.200 and shoes I can hardly wait to
00:21:48.559 hear what I can do next
00:21:57.039 year
00:22:01.200 yes you can do a lot of things all by
00:22:03.360 yourself but that means that you get to
00:22:05.480 make choices maybe you choose what you
00:22:07.960 do when you come home from school you
00:22:09.919 might choose what you're going to eat at
00:22:11.120 a restaurant I know you choose what toys
00:22:13.360 you're going to play with I've chosen
00:22:15.000 this
00:22:15.919 one even though I'm not very good at it
00:22:18.640 and many of the choices that you make
00:22:20.120 every day affect your health but do you
00:22:22.360 make healthy choices let's
00:22:25.600 see when you come home for lunch do you
00:22:28.799 run right to the table and start eating
00:22:30.919 or do you wash your hands first which is
00:22:34.080 the healthier choice after you finish
00:22:37.039 lunch do you run right out and jump on
00:22:39.039 your bike to go for a ride or do you
00:22:42.039 brush your teeth first Which choice is
00:22:44.400 better for your
00:22:46.440 body look at this great tree it'd be fun
00:22:49.480 to climb all the way to the top but it's
00:22:51.400 very high and it could be dangerous so
00:22:53.320 do you climb right up or do you wait
00:22:56.039 until a parent or an adult tells you you
00:22:58.120 that it's okay to go that
00:22:59.880 high you can make these decisions and
00:23:02.679 you can do it just like you can ride a
00:23:04.919 bicycle or turn a sumersault you can
00:23:07.120 make the decisions that are best for
00:23:08.559 your health in fact that's what growing
00:23:10.320 up is all about making healthy choices
00:23:13.360 here's one more Arnell and joy and their

00:31:26.159 oo
00:31:28.240 I'm standing in front of one of the most
00:31:30.200 dangerous places on Earth this is where
00:31:33.080 they keep
00:31:34.919 poison and sharp
00:31:37.480 knives and
00:31:40.000 explosives and mysterious
00:31:43.799 drugs scary huh today I'm going in this
00:31:47.760 dangerous place why because I live here
00:31:52.720 come
00:31:55.840 on Mom mom I'm home hi Chris I'll see
00:31:59.360 you in just a
00:32:01.360 minute you know what every year more
00:32:04.559 kids get hurt at home than any place
00:32:06.840 else it's true that's because we like to
00:32:09.519 play and some of the things we play with
00:32:12.240 are really dangerous I'll show you some
00:32:14.679 of the things in my house that are
00:32:16.580 [Music]
00:32:19.559 dangerous my dad goes hunting so he
00:32:22.240 keeps his guns in the house they're
00:32:24.519 usually locked up but sometimes s the do
00:32:28.960 open I could play with the guns if I
00:32:31.440 really wanted to but I'd never do that
00:32:34.320 because I know that thousands of kids
00:32:36.000 every year get hurt from playing with
00:32:38.039 real guns some of them even get killed
00:32:41.639 there's one more thing there's something
00:32:43.679 in every single room that can burn you
00:32:46.440 it's not fire but still can burn you
00:32:48.880 really bad up there and over
00:32:53.880 there electricity it's everywhere in
00:32:56.840 your your house but that doesn't mean
00:32:58.840 it's safe never put anything into a wall
00:33:02.000 socket or in a light that means your
00:33:05.039 fingers or a pen or a toy or anything
00:33:08.240 and if you ever see Sparks or smoke run
00:33:11.159 and tell your parents electricity is not
00:33:14.200 a
00:33:15.559 toy you think that's scary this place is
00:33:18.840 even worse the kitchen first of all look
00:33:23.799 at all these knives they are definitely
00:33:26.639 sh and it could definitely cut your skin
00:33:28.919 wide open never use a knife unless a
00:33:31.480 grownup is with
00:33:33.080 you second of all look down here what's
00:33:36.679 in all these bottles and cans I'll tell
00:33:39.360 you what poison if you swallow it they
00:33:42.519 might have to take you to the hospital
00:33:44.720 and some of it hurts if you just get it
00:33:46.440 on your skin I'm telling you stay out of
00:33:49.679 here under the sink is definitely a
00:33:52.000 grownup place and so is
00:33:55.960 this medicine when you're sick it might
00:33:59.399 be good for you but if you swallow
00:34:01.360 medicine as for somebody else it can
00:34:03.679 make you sick let your parents give you
00:34:06.200 medicine when you need
00:34:15.119 it tools can be really handy but if you
00:34:18.599 don't use them right they can also be
00:34:20.599 dangerous so never use a tool unless a
00:34:23.719 grown-up is with
00:34:25.879 you
00:34:31.719 there are a lot of things that can get
00:34:33.119 me in my house but I'm not scared cuz if
00:34:36.040 you know what to play with what not to
00:34:38.079 play with you'll be safe at
00:34:41.120 [Music]
00:34:52.639 home that's loud yeah well it's supposed
00:34:55.719 to be loud so that you'll hear it

00:37:18.359 home wa great song Paul than look at the
00:37:22.440 time I've got to go byebye bye Paula bye
00:37:25.560 bye wow wasn't that a great song on
00:37:27.880 safety wow and wasn't it scary how Paula
00:37:31.640 just happened to know a song about
00:37:33.359 safety just as we were talking about a
00:37:35.240 smoke
00:37:38.200 alarm but you know it is important to
00:37:40.400 talk about safety and smoke alarms and
00:37:42.960 fire for example what do you think the
00:37:46.000 first thing is that you should do if
00:37:47.760 there's a fire in your house should you
00:37:50.280 try to put the fire out yourself should
00:37:52.920 you get out of the house should you try
00:37:56.000 to grab all your toys and things and try
00:37:58.000 to save them you
00:38:00.920 decide and the correct answer is get out
00:38:04.319 of the house as quickly as possible
00:38:06.880 don't try to put the fire out yourself
00:38:08.520 because that's a very difficult thing to
00:38:09.920 do and you might actually make it worse
00:38:12.200 and don't try to save anything because
00:38:14.160 the most valuable thing in the house is
00:38:16.200 you your parents and your friends want
00:38:18.480 you to be safe too so meet them outside
00:38:21.200 or if there's nobody around go to a
00:38:22.880 neighbor now suppose you wake up in the
00:38:26.079 middle of the night night and your
00:38:27.359 bedroom is completely filled with smoke
00:38:29.680 and there's so much smoke that you can't
00:38:31.240 see anything do you know what to do do
00:38:33.640 you know Tiffany yes can you show us
00:38:39.119 sure oh no the room's all full with
00:38:42.160 smoke I can't see
00:38:46.560 anything great did you see what she did
00:38:49.720 she got down on her hands and knees and
00:38:51.640 crawled out of the room good stuff
00:38:53.480 Tiffany and that's what you should do
00:38:55.240 because smoke always Rises to the top of
00:38:58.160 the room first so if this room actually
00:39:00.680 was filled with smoke it may only come
00:39:02.480 down to about here down here there may
00:39:05.240 not be any smoke at all so you can not
00:39:07.000 only breathe better but you can see
00:39:08.839 better as well I know something else
00:39:11.119 what's that I know what to do if our
00:39:12.920 clothes ever catch on fire I do too so
00:39:15.839 do I okay then why don't you all tell us
00:39:18.240 what to do when your clothes are on fire
00:39:20.280 stop drop and roll bravo bravo just
00:39:24.480 think stop drop and roll roll don't try
00:39:27.800 to run because that might make the fire
00:39:30.040 worse so stop what you're doing then
00:39:32.680 drop to the ground and roll
00:39:35.920 around and that's the best thing to do
00:39:38.280 if your clothes ever catch on fire so
00:39:40.240 what is it kids stop drop and
00:39:44.680 roll going places is a lot of fun but
00:39:47.440 you have to be careful when you're not
00:39:48.800 at home because you can hurt yourself in
00:39:50.440 a lot of different ways Sam and chow and
00:39:52.920 Naomi can show us some of the things
00:39:54.480 that they do to be safe when they're not
00:39:56.119 at home
00:39:57.200 home there are lots of things you can do
00:39:59.640 to make bike riding safer like this book
00:40:02.520 bag if I didn't have a book bag and I
00:40:04.680 had to carry some books home from school
00:40:06.960 I could only ride with one hand and
00:40:09.480 that's not only dangerous it's stupid
00:40:12.400 you should always ride with both hands
00:40:15.520 and I have reflectors I have one on the
00:40:17.960 front and one on the back and one on
00:40:20.160 both wheels and I have a light in case
00:40:23.040 I'm ever out riding with my parents and
00:40:25.000 it gets dark I I want cars to be able to
00:40:27.440 see me and hear
00:40:29.520 me but do you know the thing on my bike
00:40:32.119 that makes it really really safe me I
00:40:35.880 make my bike safe because I know how to
00:40:38.000 ride
00:40:39.079 safely I always ride on the right side
00:40:41.440 of the road I stop at stop signs and of
00:40:44.480 course at red
00:40:46.079 lights this isn't very smart see when we
00:40:49.480 ride side by side we take up almost the
00:40:52.319 whole street then cars can't get
00:40:55.319 by
00:40:56.960 this is much better now cars can get by
00:41:00.040 do you know the hand signals for turning
00:41:03.040 this means I'm turning
00:41:04.680 right this means I'm turning
00:41:07.520 left I walk places every day when I
00:41:11.040 cross the street I always cross at the
00:41:13.200 corner if there's a crosswalk I cross
00:41:15.960 the street there a crosswalk looks like
00:41:21.079 this let's go for a ride in the
00:41:25.240 car
00:41:35.040 a
00:41:37.630 [Music]
00:41:44.119 new wait I'm not safe
00:41:48.630 [Music]
00:41:50.839 yet now I'm safe let's
00:41:55.240 go
00:41:58.119 you know the great thing about Chow
00:41:59.839 wearing his seat belt or Sam riding her
00:42:02.680 bike safely or Naomi looking both ways
00:42:04.800 before she crosses the street they're
00:42:07.040 kids just like you and they've taken
00:42:09.640 responsibility for their own safety you
00:42:12.319 know that's an important part of growing
00:42:14.160 up is learning how to take care of
00:42:15.760 yourself and you can do that you can
00:42:18.119 make safe choices every day now let me
00:42:20.920 give you an
00:42:22.040 example suppose a stranger somebody you
00:42:25.559 don't know starts talking to you suppose
00:42:28.400 this stranger wants to give you
00:42:29.880 something or take you for a ride in
00:42:31.800 their car what should you do well why
00:42:34.960 don't you take responsibility and find
00:42:36.720 out ask your teacher or ask your parents
00:42:39.599 what you should do if a stranger talks
00:42:41.480 to you you can do it you can find out
00:42:44.280 what's safe and that's
00:42:46.440 important your home can be a dangerous
00:42:48.960 place grown up things like guns and
00:42:51.760 knives cleaning materials and medicine
00:42:54.319 these are not toys they can hurt you
00:42:57.400 electricity is dangerous too if your
00:43:00.079 house is on fire the best thing to do is
00:43:02.200 to get out as fast as you can if there's
00:43:04.880 a lot of smoke crawl on the ground if
00:43:08.200 your clothes catch fire remember stop
00:43:11.280 drop and roll learn how to make your
00:43:14.440 bike safe always obey street signs and
00:43:17.359 traffic lights and ride single file so
00:43:20.400 cars can pass when you go walking always
00:43:23.720 look both ways before you cross cross
00:43:26.800 the street at the corner look for a
00:43:29.000 traffic light or a
