00:28:57.039 we want to tell you some stories stories
00:28:59.440 about schools that are thriving
00:29:01.840 even though they confront some of the
00:29:03.440 worst problems in education today
00:29:06.320 how do they do it and what can we learn
00:29:08.640 from them that will help
00:29:09.679 improve other schools
00:29:15.920 
00:29:34.880 maybe you want to improve your school
00:29:36.880 and you'd like some help
00:29:38.399 that's why we produced every child can
00:29:40.720 succeed
00:29:42.399 it's a package of video and print
00:29:44.240 materials designed for administrators
00:29:46.559 parents teachers and others to use as
00:29:49.520 part of an effort to improve schools
00:29:52.960 in part one of this program we'll
00:29:54.640 examine the materials in the package
00:29:58.559 and in part two we'll demonstrate how
00:30:00.799 you can use them to help create positive
00:30:02.960 change
00:30:03.440 in your school
00:30:10.240 every child can succeed has three
00:30:12.159 components the demonstration component
00:30:15.039 the successful schools component and the
00:30:17.679 essential
00:30:18.320 elements component
00:30:21.520 the demonstration component is for
00:30:23.440 school trustees
00:30:24.880 administrators teachers and parent and
00:30:27.840 community groups
00:30:29.600 this component includes two video
00:30:31.520 programs the first
00:30:33.120 is promises to keep achieving success in
00:30:35.760 our schools
00:30:37.200 we say that we believe that all children
00:30:40.159 can learn
00:30:41.440 and i believe that almost every educator
00:30:45.200 wants desperately to believe that and
00:30:48.559 may sometimes even believe that they
00:30:50.159 believe it and yet
00:30:51.760 they nurture doubts that they can
00:30:54.640 produce the educational outcomes
00:30:57.039 in situations that are difficult
00:31:01.120 the other video program in the
00:31:02.720 demonstration component
00:31:04.399 is using every child can succeed which
00:31:07.120 you're watching now
00:31:10.080 besides the video programs the
00:31:12.159 demonstration component also contains a
00:31:14.480 guide for educational policy makers
00:31:17.039 including advice on how to support
00:31:18.799 change at the local level
00:31:21.840 the purpose of the demonstration
00:31:23.279 component is to encourage policymakers
00:31:25.679 to adopt
00:31:26.320 plans and commit resources to meet the
00:31:28.399 needs of all students
00:31:32.880 the second component in every child can
00:31:34.720 succeed is the successful schools
00:31:37.039 component
00:31:38.000 it's for administrators teachers
00:31:40.000 community members
00:31:41.120 and parents the successful schools
00:31:44.559 component
00:31:45.279 features six 30-minute video programs
00:31:49.760 wouldn't it be great if your entire
00:31:51.360 staff could go on a field trip
00:31:52.960 to eight diverse and successful
00:31:54.960 elementary schools
00:31:56.559 well here's the next best thing we'll
00:31:59.039 bring the schools to you
00:32:02.880 the programs are the van school a

00:32:26.320 this is a school with one every facial
00:32:28.640 thing has a feeling
00:32:30.000 all of a sudden your team's down there
00:32:31.519 you're down to the floor casey is coming
00:32:33.120 to back

00:32:43.279 in seattle you're missing a park
00:32:47.440 and the part that you're missing in this
00:32:49.360 class lori eba
00:32:50.880 and diane thompkinson are teaching their
00:32:52.720 first graders about sea life
00:32:54.960 they're about to take a field trip to
00:32:56.480 the beach
00:32:58.000 remember we counted them how many does
00:32:59.919 it happen it has
00:33:01.039 20. the next day they're off on the
00:33:02.880 field trip
00:33:04.159 50 first graders newly certified as
00:33:08.840 beachologists
00:33:10.159 this time i found the kind of um
00:33:13.039 starfish you were talking about the
00:33:14.720 purple one
00:33:16.399 oh i see it what do you see
00:33:20.640 they attach to the rocks with all these
00:33:22.559 two feet and they become totally
00:33:24.480 engrossed in what it is that they're
00:33:26.080 doing
00:33:27.039 and the motivation is there the the
00:33:30.080 feeling that
00:33:31.039 god we want to learn all we can about it
00:33:34.720 and it just seems to create
00:33:38.880 a feeling in them that they they can do
00:33:41.679 it and they want to do it
00:33:43.039 and it has meaning to them and i think
00:33:45.120 that's the whole
00:33:46.240 point of what we're doing for kids is to
00:33:49.039 create meaning for them
00:33:52.000 along with the six video programs the
00:33:54.399 successful schools component includes a
00:33:56.399 facilitator's guide
00:33:59.279 the guide has suggested workshop agendas
00:34:02.000 handouts
00:34:03.039 background details on the featured
00:34:04.559 schools and tips on how to use the
00:34:06.960 videos to stimulate discussion
00:34:09.310 
00:34:11.440 the purpose of this component is to
00:34:13.280 encourage viewers to consider
00:34:14.960 and maybe even reconsider their
00:34:16.800 fundamental assumptions about schools
00:34:19.040 and schooling if we don't believe that
00:34:22.560 every child
00:34:23.199 can succeed if we don't have that
00:34:24.399 attitude all these resources and
00:34:26.960 wonderful computers and so forth aren't
00:34:28.960 going to do us any good because we
00:34:30.719 we will use those resources for certain
00:34:32.960 children and not for other children so i
00:34:35.040 think it's an attitude
00:34:37.040 the third component in every child can
00:34:39.119 succeed is the essential
00:34:40.960 elements component it's primarily for
00:34:43.520 principals and teachers
00:34:45.359 this component has nine 20-minute video
00:34:48.000 programs
00:34:51.520 the videos explore elements that
00:34:53.199 research has identified
00:34:54.560 as essential for school improvement
00:34:57.760 the essential elements are instructional
00:35:00.839 leadership tell me about this one
00:35:03.280 school leadership high expectations
00:35:08.720 parent involvement productive
00:35:12.079 climate and culture monitoring student
00:35:15.520 progress
00:35:17.520 learning essential skills
00:35:20.560 effective instructional strategies
00:35:23.839 and staff development okay
00:35:27.440 what you're watching now is the end
00:35:29.119 result of previous staff development
00:35:32.640 teacher diane thompkinson was looking
00:35:34.720 for active listening techniques
00:35:36.960 a staff development expert from outside
00:35:39.040 the school showed her how to use an
00:35:40.960 instructional technique
00:35:42.160 called story painter
00:35:45.280 the children paint a picture to present
00:35:47.040 their vision of what a story is about
00:35:49.599 and you get a lot better listening
00:35:51.520 skills when they try to imagine
00:35:54.560 what is going on in the story and
00:35:56.000 particularly when they know they're
00:35:57.040 going to have an opportunity
00:35:58.320 to paint their favorite part and that we
00:36:00.800 are going to work with a story
00:36:02.640 and describe that chapter what do you
00:36:05.280 want to say about
00:36:06.320 chapter three what do you think sabun
00:36:08.320 was illustrating here
00:36:10.240 because story painter works so well in
00:36:12.400 diane tomkinson's class
00:36:14.320 joan dore of the academic achievement
00:36:16.480 office has come to elk high school to
00:36:18.960 share the process with others
00:36:21.200 the student got up and told about
00:36:25.119 the cat and the first chapter the other
00:36:28.240 students
00:36:28.800 added information and together then
00:36:32.720 with the teacher modeling and the
00:36:34.160 students directing you know this
00:36:36.079 sequence this sequence
00:36:38.079 this is the summary of the first chapter
00:36:40.880 that they came up with
00:36:42.160 
00:36:43.359 along with the nine video programs the
00:36:45.920 essential elements component contains a
00:36:47.839 facilitator's guide
00:36:49.200 with workshop agendas handouts and
00:36:52.400 suggestions on planning for change in
00:36:54.480 local schools
00:36:56.960 the purpose of this component is to help
00:36:59.200 principals and teachers develop
00:37:00.880 action plans for implementing the
00:37:02.800 essential elements in their own schools
00:37:06.800 the package also includes a book of
00:37:08.640 readings
00:37:10.079 inside there's a large collection of
00:37:11.839 background readings for use with both
00:37:14.000 the successful schools
00:37:15.359 and essential elements components
00:37:22.400 a lot shorter there is no one correct
00:37:24.960 way to use the every child can succeed
00:37:26.960 materials
00:37:28.079 the components have several different
00:37:29.680 audiences and purposes
00:37:31.520 but the primary purpose of the series is
00:37:33.680 to support improvement
00:37:34.960 and reform at the local school level
00:37:38.079 here's a suggested format that uses all
00:37:40.480 of the materials effectively
00:37:43.920 at the first session show the promises
00:37:46.400 to keep video program
00:37:48.000 from the demonstration component if our
00:37:50.800 schools
00:37:51.440 are to be everything that they can be
00:37:55.119 it is absolutely essential that we have
00:37:57.520 a deep and abiding faith
00:37:59.280 in the abilities of children and in the
00:38:02.480 abilities of
00:38:03.520 educators to stimulate children to the
00:38:06.320 point
00:38:06.960 of academic excellence the fact is that
00:38:09.760 we've got the information and we know it
00:38:11.839 can be done
00:38:12.640 we haven't done it we know attribution
00:38:15.359 theory
00:38:16.560 after you've watched the video discuss
00:38:18.640 it
00:38:21.520 then decide whether your staff wants to
00:38:23.280 see more materials
00:38:24.800 if they do schedule another session
00:38:29.040 to begin the second session conduct the
00:38:31.280 focusing activity in the facilitator's
00:38:33.280 guide
00:38:34.000 which asks can every child succeed in
00:38:36.560 school
00:38:37.119 a change in attitude instead of looking
00:38:40.000 at those factors and seeing
00:38:42.079 what these are the reasons why these
00:38:43.680 kids aren't performing
00:38:45.599 you look at those factors and you say
00:38:47.839 well they seem to be doing well over
00:38:49.680 here so why don't the three
00:38:51.200 of you take a look at what is going on
00:38:53.839 over here that's causing those
00:38:55.520 kids to be successful they're the same
00:38:58.560 kids the backgrounds are very similar so
00:39:00.880 it has to be something that's going on
00:39:02.880 in your schools to cause these kids to
00:39:05.760 experience success
00:39:07.200 that's not going on yeah and probably
00:39:08.960 the resources are the same or
00:39:10.640 approximately the same advice
00:39:13.680 after the discussion move into the
00:39:15.760 successful schools component
00:39:18.240 very often and we found it in our group
00:39:20.000 and i'm sure you probably did too
00:39:22.079 as we were trying to make a statement
00:39:24.160 but words crept in
00:39:27.280 all children can succeed but all
00:39:30.400 children can succeed
00:39:31.839 if you know those types of things become
00:39:34.640 barriers
00:39:36.000 the successful school videos really are
00:39:38.480 going to
00:39:39.359 energize a faculty to perhaps begin to
00:39:42.560 pull down
00:39:43.359 or at least create some doubt
00:39:46.720 as to the excuses and that's what it's
00:39:50.560 intended to do
00:39:52.480 next show one of the successful school
00:39:54.839 videos there are suggestions for how to
00:39:57.280 view and discuss the video in the
00:39:58.880 facilitator's guide
00:40:03.599 and show me with your signals how are
00:40:05.599 you feeling today
00:40:06.800 how are you feeling all right look at
00:40:08.240 those one program intended to produce
00:40:10.480 self-motivated students is something
00:40:12.319 called project c
00:40:15.280 a requirement for every student in
00:40:17.119 grades four through six
00:40:19.680 at first glance project seed is simply a
00:40:22.480 different way of teaching advanced
00:40:24.000 mathematics latoya unless everyone let's
00:40:26.160 read it follow my finger
00:40:31.520 equals four if and only if
00:40:34.960 two to the power four 16.
00:40:38.560 all right but actually this is much more
00:40:40.800 than just math
00:40:42.480 william glee has been a project seed
00:40:44.560 specialist for 10 years
00:40:47.119 we use mathematics as a two and the two
00:40:51.359 is to raise the self-confidence and
00:40:54.240 self-esteem
00:40:55.119 you can raise their self-esteem by
00:40:57.280 teaching how to play
00:40:58.480 chess uh but when you teach them how to
00:41:01.520 the mathematics and
00:41:02.880 and get them excited about their
00:41:04.400 learning education
00:41:06.079 because education is the key for a lot
00:41:08.560 of these kids
00:41:09.599 to be successful after watching the
00:41:13.040 program
00:41:14.000 focus the discussion on the school in
00:41:16.000 the video
00:41:19.119 you know that jumps out right at you in
00:41:20.640 fact it's almost frightening
00:41:22.880 if i was a if i was a faculty member
00:41:25.040 there i might you know i'd have to
00:41:26.079 assess right quick like now do i really
00:41:27.839 want this
00:41:28.800 i think strong instructional leadership
00:41:30.560 principle the the
00:41:32.000 overall the high expectations certainly
00:41:34.640 they're on the part of all faculty
00:41:36.000 members
00:41:37.040 we saw hands-on activities taking place
00:41:41.040 they did address various learning styles
00:41:43.839 they talked about the socratic
00:41:45.280 questioning technique relative to
00:41:47.280 project seed
00:41:49.200 in the third session you might watch
00:41:51.280 another successful schools video
00:41:54.160 all of us want to get along he's also
00:41:56.000 devoted to maintaining discipline
00:41:57.839 any conflicts but when conflicts do come
00:42:00.000 up we need to handle them because you're
00:42:01.680 going to have conflicts throughout your
00:42:02.960 whole life
00:42:05.280 and you need to know you need to have
00:42:06.720 the skills sometimes it's done in a
00:42:08.240 group handle those conflicts when they
00:42:09.920 do come up
00:42:10.800 school is not a happy place when you
00:42:12.319 don't have friends sometimes one-on-one
00:42:15.359 behavior that is disruptive to that
00:42:17.920 interferes with the teacher's teaching
00:42:19.359 or interviews
00:42:20.240 interferes with other children's
00:42:21.520 learning needs to be dealt with
00:42:23.359 immediately and specifically
00:42:25.280 and fairly and lovingly and it's not
00:42:28.160 just one person's job
00:42:29.520 again it's one of those dynamics of a
00:42:31.119 successful school that everybody works
00:42:33.359 together
00:42:35.040 after the video follow the same
00:42:36.960 discussion format as before
00:42:40.480 among those things you saw what do all
00:42:43.680 three
00:42:44.000 of these schools have in common at the
00:42:46.480 fourth session
00:42:47.599 compare the schools you've seen secondly
00:42:50.880 in what ways are these three schools
00:42:53.680 most different
00:42:55.520 beacon hills
00:43:09.440 but not the first one but alkali was the
00:43:12.400 only one that was non-graded
00:43:13.839 right use the suggestions and handouts
00:43:17.920 in the facilitator's guide to help
00:43:19.680 focus the group discussions what
00:43:23.359 is behind you're bringing that up
00:43:25.200 discipline is very important to a school
00:43:27.040 and
00:43:27.599 particularly important is how the
00:43:30.160 discipline is rendered
00:43:32.240 and um this it seemed to me
00:43:35.760 that this fellow gave a rendition of
00:43:37.440 discipline that was compassionate but
00:43:39.359 firm
00:43:40.400 and it wasn't so much punitive and how
00:43:43.520 you
00:43:43.920 handle discipline is one of the factors
00:43:46.240 in having an effective school but
00:43:48.079 in the beacon hill tape we saw that it
00:43:49.760 was actually dealt with
00:43:51.280 and the other two tapes were almost too
00:43:53.760 good to be true
00:43:55.680 the program is intended to cause
00:43:58.000 reflection
00:43:59.119 not replication necessarily there's
00:44:01.280 nothing wrong with seeing something in
00:44:03.119 tape
00:44:04.000 that really excites you and and that you
00:44:06.880 grab onto and say
00:44:09.040 let's run with that let's adopt that
00:44:10.640 here let's try to get that in place here
00:44:13.040 and to reject something that you've seen
00:44:14.880 another tape because it doesn't seem
00:44:17.200 to strike uh your fancy your context
00:44:19.760 your situation
00:44:20.880 the programs get the school staff
00:44:22.560 dealing with the issues
00:44:24.079 that they identify are important whether
00:44:26.319 they see
00:44:28.240 a disciplined approach on the tape that
00:44:30.000 they like or not the fact that the tape
00:44:32.319 somehow gets them to talk about
00:44:34.319 discipline maybe what we're after
00:44:37.839 by the fifth session you should be ready
00:44:40.079 to set priorities
00:44:41.440 and decide what essential elements to
00:44:43.200 examine in detail
00:44:45.040 show the related video program imagine a
00:44:47.760 school called euclid avenue elementary
00:44:50.160 in east los angeles it is dirty
00:44:53.359 dangerous one of the lowest achieving
00:44:55.280 schools in the city
00:44:57.280 now imagine that someone calls and says
00:44:59.520 you are to leave your successful school
00:45:02.319 and become the new principal at euclid
00:45:05.040 it happened to esther mcshane
00:45:07.680 i actually thought it was a joke i
00:45:09.760 resisted i said i'm not coming
00:45:12.720 and i was told i'll meet you there at 10
00:45:14.880 30 the next morning
00:45:16.560 and it certainly was a shock i didn't
00:45:19.040 want to be here
00:45:20.240 i wasn't looking for another challenge
00:45:24.079 ruth johnson of the california
00:45:25.680 achievement council understood the
00:45:27.520 problems at euclid
00:45:28.960 there was racial tension there was
00:45:32.000 uh tension of teachers that were not
00:45:35.200 talking to each other in the halls
00:45:38.400 there was no focus on looking at kids
00:45:41.520 and achievement
00:45:43.200 it was a fractured school very
00:45:44.839 fragmented
00:45:47.440 throw things out the car absolutely that
00:45:49.760 we're gonna have we're gonna have the
00:45:50.960 cleanest highways in the world with the
00:45:52.960 kids in this classroom
00:45:54.319 what else esther mcshane developed a
00:45:56.319 clear mission for her new school
00:45:58.480 academic success for every child
00:46:02.960 that meant cleaning up the campus
00:46:05.839 improving instruction
00:46:07.280 and increasing student achievement
00:46:10.560 i have made a difference because i have
00:46:13.440 empowered
00:46:14.079 people are you ready for them
00:46:17.680 after you've watched the program use the
00:46:20.000 tips in the facilitator's guide to
00:46:21.760 generate discussion
00:46:23.839 and to begin planning for school
00:46:25.760 improvement
00:46:27.200 if the goal were to improve our
00:46:28.800 communication of course besides covering
00:46:31.200 the suggestions in the guide
00:46:32.800 you're always free to add your own
00:46:34.480 techniques and insights on school
00:46:36.480 improvement
00:46:37.119 right and to overcome resistance uh you
00:46:40.160 need three things
00:46:42.160 there has to be dissatisfaction with the
00:46:44.079 status quo
00:46:46.079 but if you just have dissatisfaction all
00:46:48.319 by itself that's not enough you also
00:46:50.319 need
00:46:50.720 a vision of a preferred future
00:46:54.240 and even if you have a dissatisfaction
00:46:56.240 and a vision of how
00:46:57.920 to alleviate this dissatisfaction make
00:47:00.240 things better
00:47:01.200 that's still not enough you need the
00:47:02.720 first steps toward that vision
00:47:06.319 and if you have those three things in
00:47:08.400 place
00:47:09.599 those three things are greater than
00:47:11.200 resistance now
00:47:13.359 knowing your mathematics as you do you
00:47:15.520 realize that
00:47:16.800 if there's a zero at any place in a
00:47:20.160 multiplication formula you don't
00:47:23.200 overcome the resistance
00:47:26.160 at additional meetings you can focus on
00:47:28.240 other essential elements
00:47:30.079 always remember the essential elements
00:47:32.240 work together at successful schools
00:47:34.720 therefore you might want to break into
00:47:36.240 groups that will plan how to implement
00:47:38.240 the various elements
00:47:39.440 in your school again use the videos and
00:47:42.480 print to guide your discussion
00:47:44.319 and planning
00:47:49.119 do you believe your school can do better
00:47:51.839 the educators and parents
00:47:53.280 in these schools believe it they are
00:47:55.280 driven to create ongoing programs and
00:47:57.599 strategies that equal success for
00:47:59.440 children
00:48:00.720 our videos in print will show you how
00:48:02.559 they did it and help your school plan
00:48:04.800 ongoing efforts
00:48:06.000 to do the same we supply the materials
00:48:10.160 you supply the energy
00:48:11.599 the commitment and the persistence to
00:48:13.680 make them work
00:48:14.960 because every child can succeed and will
00:48:18.160 with your support
00:48:22.430
