00:00:50.680 come on
00:00:52.199 in settle
00:00:54.520 back it's curtain time at the story lane
00:00:58.000 theater you've never seen a stage like
00:01:00.440 this
00:01:01.519 one anything can happen
00:01:17.360 here in a few minutes we'll hear why all
00:01:20.759 stories belong to Anansi the trickster
00:01:23.799 spider from Africa but first let's go to
00:01:27.360 New York City for a backstage visit with
00:01:29.560 Steven guacha the artist who drew the
00:01:32.360 pictures for the
00:01:36.759 show this studio the place where I work
00:01:39.840 is the place I feel the the happiest
00:01:44.360 working this is a place that I go
00:01:47.520 to
00:01:49.200 um to just be with my imagination
00:01:53.079 really and therefore it's a place that I
00:01:56.280 find a really really fun place to make
00:01:58.840 drawings um I just sit here at this at
00:02:02.280 this desk and I just have to look around
00:02:04.920 a little bit and I start to have ideas
00:02:06.600 for
00:02:08.550 [Music]
00:02:11.800 pictures when I was in second and third
00:02:13.959 grade I was sick with aaic fever and I
00:02:17.319 was bedridden for a lot of time so
00:02:19.840 instead of going out and uh I didn't
00:02:22.080 really have an opportunity to ride my
00:02:23.560 bicycle or to play ball um I spent a lot
00:02:27.239 of time looking and reading
00:02:31.560 watching um and so books
00:02:35.560 and uh animated cartoons all sorts of
00:02:38.720 drawn things became the things that I I
00:02:42.000 really I lived with and I never stopped
00:02:44.800 being interested in those
00:02:46.879 things I carry a Sketchbook with me
00:02:49.519 everywhere so the very first drawings of
00:02:52.400 ananzi were made in this Sketchbook but
00:02:55.480 they didn't even really look like a niy
00:02:58.280 who's kind of parts Part person part
00:03:00.640 spider um his hair is a little more
00:03:03.040 realistic he's wearing eyeglasses that
00:03:04.959 look like the kind of eyeglasses people
00:03:06.400 really wear none of those things seemed
00:03:08.360 interesting or special enough so the
00:03:10.720 next thing that I did was to work on the
00:03:14.959 shapes of the character I decided that
00:03:16.720 instead of those realistic eyeglasses he
00:03:19.000 needed round circles they looked a
00:03:20.959 little bit more like eyes at the same
00:03:23.640 time that they looked like
00:03:25.720 eyeglasses and I started to play with
00:03:28.360 his beard and his hair
00:03:30.519 and I changed the soft floppy hat to a
00:03:32.680 top hat which seemed more like a
00:03:33.760 trickster's
00:03:35.000 [Music]
00:03:44.000 hat and Nancy was a
00:03:46.519 perfect chance to get everything I felt
00:03:50.439 about bugs into a into a whole story a
00:03:53.760 nzi is he's a bug he's a spider but he's
00:03:56.599 also he's a
00:03:58.720 character
00:04:08.400 I wanted him basically to be a character
00:04:10.560 that that everybody kids or grown-ups
00:04:13.439 thought was kind of
00:04:14.879 cool he doesn't always do the right
00:04:17.680 thing he doesn't always learn his lesson
00:04:21.238 but I think that his personality is
00:04:23.560 really great he's he's got a lot of uh
00:04:26.240 he's got a great sense of humor he's
00:04:27.800 always trying to
00:04:30.639 succeed and the fact that he doesn't
00:04:33.000 succeed all the time I think just makes
00:04:34.360 him all the more endearing all the more
00:04:36.280 kind of
00:04:41.120 charming the scene that I'm drawing
00:04:43.199 right now is right
00:04:45.960 before the Hat
00:04:48.160 shaking dance that an nizi performs and
00:04:52.000 of course he performs it because he's
00:04:54.479 got a hat full of hot hot beans that
00:04:57.639 he's just plumped down on his head
00:05:00.520 and the beans are hot hotter than
00:05:04.440 anything he's ever experienced and his
00:05:07.000 hair is acting like bolts of lightning
00:05:08.639 shooting off of his head his eyes are
00:05:11.759 bulging out of his head about to
00:05:15.120 pop and his teeth are
00:05:18.440 clenched and uh in the next scene his
00:05:22.919 eyes are going to do a uh kind of
00:05:25.560 a spiral like this that's when things
00:05:29.160 get really hot and you won't be able to
00:05:32.600 even see
00:05:33.460 [Music]
00:05:37.039 straight if I had to come up with one
00:05:38.919 important thing that I told kids it
00:05:40.560 would be to do the things that you love
00:05:42.199 to do the most whether that's taking
00:05:44.680 care of animals or playing sports or
00:05:47.440 drawing or reading uh whatever it is I
00:05:50.319 think you do the things best that you
00:05:52.280 love doing and uh I've spent my life
00:05:55.319 doing the one thing that I love to do
00:05:56.720 more than anything which is to draw make
00:05:58.840 pictures
00:06:00.199 and um you I don't think you can go
00:06:03.080 wrong if you do what you like thanks
00:06:05.800 Stephen and now let's head for Jamaica

00:33:01.679 theater you've never seen a stage like
00:33:04.120 this
00:33:05.200 one anything can happen
00:33:20.880 here today we're going to hear the story
00:33:23.399 of BR rabbit and boss lion the story was
00:33:26.799 first written down about 100 Years Ago
00:33:29.080 by a man named Joel Chandler Harris who
00:33:31.720 lived not too far from this house
00:33:33.399 outside Atlanta Georgia Mr Harris wrote
00:33:36.639 down all kinds of stories he heard
00:33:38.559 people telling throughout the South and
00:33:40.720 he called them the Uncle Remis Stories
00:33:43.760 the two people you see sitting out on
00:33:45.360 the porch are Bill Meyer and his wife
00:33:47.639 Lee bill is the person who made the
00:33:50.000 pictures you'll see in the
00:33:52.559 show I love doing art it's just a
00:33:55.760 wonderful thing and a marvelous thing to
00:33:57.399 make a living at it's something that
00:34:00.320 that always has been a part of me from
00:34:03.039 the time I was very very young and it's
00:34:05.480 impossible for me to escape you know if
00:34:07.760 there's a if there's a party and some
00:34:10.079 kids drawing on the floor I'd much
00:34:11.560 rather sit down on the floor and draw
00:34:13.040 with the kids than sit around and talk
00:34:15.280 to
00:34:17.440 adults I mean for me drawing is the most
00:34:21.399 wonderful way to express yourself and uh
00:34:24.879 most of my drawings have a lot of humor
00:34:26.679 in them but it's because that's really
00:34:28.359 the way I view life I see humor and
00:34:32.839 everything most of the time when I sit
00:34:34.800 down to draw little characters of
00:34:36.800 animals it's more like a stream of
00:34:40.000 Consciousness when I started on the BR
00:34:42.440 rabbit video since it was a little town
00:34:44.440 on the river that's how I sort of
00:34:45.960 pictured it I took my canoe down to the
00:34:48.159 chattah huchi river and I and I got in
00:34:50.560 the canoe and leave brought her book and
00:34:52.280 she was reading her book and uh I just
00:34:54.679 started doing little thumbnail sketches
00:34:56.480 of how I pictured the Little River Town
00:34:59.079 to
00:34:59.690 [Music]
00:35:01.079 be and it's funny you know when you're
00:35:03.359 floating down the river going past
00:35:05.040 little decaying Barns and um you know
00:35:09.000 trees and the way that trees are foggy
00:35:11.720 in the morning and Misty and all of that
00:35:14.160 stuff just sort of seeps its way
00:35:16.920 in you absorb the things that you're
00:35:19.240 around and and uh when they come out
00:35:21.800 they come out in more of a personal
00:35:24.680 way my idea of how I saw the um images
00:35:28.359 on the screen the village and the
00:35:31.040 characters were very different from the
00:35:33.640 way they've been interpreted before the
00:35:36.119 little town I had a idea to picture it
00:35:39.440 in the way that I always remembered this
00:35:41.400 house the little houses were leaning and
00:35:44.079 sort of patch tin roofs the way people
00:35:46.400 dress and overalls what they wear and
00:35:49.119 the way they act are just things that
00:35:51.400 I've always seen in the country when I
00:35:52.880 take drives you know and I tend to just
00:35:54.880 remember them and try and use them the
00:35:57.760 little characters like the Buzzard
00:36:00.040 happens to look a lot like my neighbor
00:36:02.359 down the street in fact his kids kind of
00:36:04.720 recognized him one day and went oh it's
00:36:07.119 Dad
00:36:08.599 look even the little pigs and uh geese
00:36:12.800 that are being swallowed by the lion
00:36:14.800 they do tend to resemble my nieces and
00:36:19.800 nephews these are some cutouts that I
00:36:22.040 did of bear rabbit I always saw bear
00:36:24.680 rabbit as not a cute character but but
00:36:26.680 one that had a lot of personality he's a
00:36:28.760 rascal he's very intelligent a bragger
00:36:32.040 um a little bit full of himself and the
00:36:34.680 way we use these cutout is we um we have
00:36:38.359 a background and we place them on the
00:36:41.440 background by overlaying the figures
00:36:44.280 over the top the rabbit sort of acted
00:36:46.200 out the scene where he's saying goodbye
00:36:48.000 to all the towns people that way it
00:36:50.480 allowed us to uh show a lot of
00:36:52.079 expression and a lot of movement as it
00:36:53.640 went
00:36:56.520 through
00:37:01.480 I think the feeling I'd love for people
00:37:02.920 to have when they finish with the story
00:37:04.839 is that that they really had a great
00:37:06.680 time listening to it Uncle Remis for me
00:37:09.520 is something I remember my grandmother
00:37:11.040 reading me and it has a real fond
00:37:13.000 memories because they were wonderful
00:37:15.079 Stories the stories always had a way of
00:37:17.760 telling morals or explanations for
00:37:21.160 things that happen in our lives the
00:37:23.880 moral for Boss lion is that if if you
00:37:26.880 use your intell elligence you can pretty
00:37:28.359 much outsmart anyone you can overcome
00:37:30.880 things that obstacles in your
00:37:33.839 life thanks Bill and now let's watch the
00:37:37.839 story of BR rabbit and boss
00:37:40.890 [Music]
00:37:56.440 lion
00:38:00.470 [Music]
00:38:26.440 n
00:38:27.490 [Music]
00:38:36.319 way down in the deepest
00:38:41.440 South along the river they now call a
00:38:44.079 Mississippi there once lived an assembly
00:38:47.000 of animals who were all the best of
00:38:52.839 friends now this was a good long time
00:38:55.720 ago so long ago that most folks forget
00:38:59.119 but some still remember how the animals
00:39:01.599 in bird Village got along just as kindly
00:39:05.079 as any a critter
00:39:09.160 could they helped each other out of
00:39:11.560 fixes and fixed each other out of Hard
00:39:15.960 Times things were Peaceable and pleasant
00:39:20.760 generally speaking that
00:39:22.660 [Music]
00:39:26.359 is but one day all that change when boss
00:39:30.880 lion the king of the forest as he liked
00:39:34.200 to call himself came along and set
00:39:37.079 himself down in an old cave on the
00:39:40.079 outskirts of bur
00:39:43.800 village now as everyone knows or ought
00:39:47.920 to know Boss line was not a f to be
00:39:52.599 messing
00:39:54.520 with he was the meanest baddest biggest
00:39:59.000 smelliest proudest fattest cat in the
00:40:02.359 forest and it was not so nice
00:40:09.160 besides he had a mouth full of scissors
00:40:12.440 shark teeth he had claws that could cut
00:40:15.920 clear through a cottonwood tree and a m
00:40:18.599 of hair which he kept slit and oil at
00:40:21.800 all
00:40:22.680 times and this here boss lion if it
00:40:26.560 isn't clear already was certainly no
00:40:33.359 vegetarian and sure as a Hogs a pig and
00:40:37.200 vice versa Boss line led up to his
00:40:41.119 ferocious
00:40:42.839 reputation he gobbled up Paws full of
00:40:47.839 goosing he swallowed a sixpack of
00:40:54.520 piglets he laid about on the outskirts
00:40:57.880 of town fat and mean doing not a liquor
00:41:01.359 work eating up whatever animal came
00:41:03.520 along and being just generally
00:41:06.119 antisociable in his
00:41:12.680 behavior after a few days them bird
00:41:16.119 folks had enough of Boss lying and held
00:41:18.800 a meeting to see what they could do
00:41:20.720 about him they gathered in the center of
00:41:23.160 town and argued back and forth this way
00:41:25.760 and that then that way and this and a
00:41:28.359 few other ways besides and finally they
00:41:32.520 decided that someone would have to go to
00:41:35.280 boss L and explained to him the score
00:41:37.680 that if he kept up the way he was doing
00:41:40.280 he would destroy the village and there
00:41:42.359 wouldn't be no more animals left to live
00:41:44.760 there things were getting so bad they
00:41:48.079 decided to make a deal with boss L if he
00:41:51.880 promised to stay inside of his cave they
00:41:54.280 would come every day to feed him then
00:41:57.240 then B Fox stepped forward and cleared
00:42:00.359 his throat well folks he said seeing
00:42:03.599 that we got that matter settled all we
00:42:05.839 got to do now is figure out who was
00:42:08.280 going to talk to boss
00:42:11.200 L at that all them folks felt suddenly
00:42:16.319 silent after a couple minutes B Pig
00:42:19.599 snorted and spoke up I wouldn't mind one
00:42:23.680 bit telling that old line what we
00:42:25.400 decided here but I got some rooting to
00:42:28.160 do before the rains
00:42:30.319 come and then bur bear came forward I
00:42:34.520 love to give boss line a piece of my
00:42:39.400 mind he
00:42:41.319 said
00:42:42.920 but I'm behind on my berry harvest and I
00:42:47.559 got to make fruit cocktail for the Cubs
00:42:51.280 then everyone start talking all at
00:42:54.720 once Bon said he had to get his head in
00:42:58.760 from the field B Goose said he had to
00:43:02.280 take care of his wife while she laying
00:43:04.599 egg bird Goble had a headache and needed
00:43:07.720 to buy some aspirin and bird frog had to
00:43:11.480 get a haircut and then needed to pin his
00:43:15.160 Pad it looked as if no one was going to
00:43:18.240 talk to boss
00:43:21.720 Li and just as the meeting was about to
00:43:24.480 break up and everyone go off all
00:43:27.319 discouraged and defeated bur rabbit
00:43:30.800 stepped into the center of the
00:43:32.700 [Music]
00:43:35.680 circle I swear by my white whiskers he
00:43:38.880 said y'all might be too tender-footed to
00:43:41.319 tell that meany hide line what we think
00:43:43.480 of him but I'm not now Bird rabbit was
00:43:47.559 not a very big fella in fact even his
00:43:51.160 hairs go he was a puny sort of guy
00:43:54.079 always getting himself into all kinds of
00:43:56.480 unaccountable trouble on account of that
00:43:58.920 big mouth of his so bur Goble shouted
00:44:02.640 out B rabbit you you can't go to boss
00:44:07.079 line he 10 times bigger than
00:44:10.160 you yeah B Fox add it chuckling to
00:44:15.440 himself that line will eat you up as an
00:44:18.960 appetizer and make a keychain out of
00:44:21.440 your
00:44:23.880 foot now now now listen folks B rabbit
00:44:27.440 said I'm going to tell you now and y'all
00:44:30.520 listen good but rabbit ain't afraid of
00:44:34.040 nobody certainly not some scurvy breath
00:44:37.400 greasy headed flea infested boil faed
00:44:41.319 boss lion appetizer I'm off right now to
00:44:45.520 pize his paw kick him in the jaw and
00:44:48.480 maybe even mispronounce his name if I

00:44:54.480 keychain out of
00:44:56.040 who
00:44:59.599 and with that Bird rabbit hitched up his
00:45:02.319 pants and pulled his duck claw cap over
00:45:05.000 one eye he removed a cigar from his
00:45:08.119 breast pocket put it in his mouth and
00:45:10.359 saw it off to the outskirts of the
00:45:12.640 village whistling the entire time as if
00:45:15.960 he was heading to the Fish Hole to hook
00:45:18.559 him a bullheaded
00:45:23.319 catfish if the minute bir rabbit turn
00:45:26.200 the corner and was out of view from the
00:45:28.319 rest of the villages he stopped
00:45:30.079 whistling and stubbed out his
00:45:32.110 [Music]
00:45:34.160 cigar he fixed his cap straight on his
00:45:36.800 head and the closer he came to boss
00:45:39.280 Lion's
00:45:40.440 cave the more he started sweating and
00:45:44.559 shaking until his legs were wobbling so
00:45:47.200 bad he could hardly walk
00:45:52.240 straight when he got the boss Lion's
00:45:54.720 cave he took his cap off
00:45:57.440 and knocked meekly on the door tap tap
00:46:02.359 tap the door flew open and Boss line
00:46:05.480 stood in the threshold breathing
00:46:07.359 straight down bird rabbit's
00:46:09.320 [Music]

00:47:24.359 like a buckshot as fast as his furry
00:47:26.480 feet could take
00:47:29.559 it but as soon as he drew near the
00:47:32.040 village he stopped to catch his
00:47:35.559 breath he fished out his old cigar
00:47:38.480 cocked his cat back over one eye and
00:47:40.920 ambled into town just as calmly as if he
00:47:43.960 was on his way back from The Fish
00:47:47.760 Hole when they saw him coming they all

00:48:20.880 and I
00:48:22.200 did them folks was considerably curious
00:48:25.680 and demanded a bir rabbit a full
00:48:27.960 accountant of what had
00:48:29.920 happened well he
00:48:32.400 said I went straight up to that cave
00:48:35.640 invited myself in and sat down on the
00:48:38.119 chair Crossing Boss line and I put it to
00:48:41.319 him directly saying look here Mr L
00:48:45.559 you're disturbing the peace of our
00:48:48.359 village not to say eating us all the AL
00:48:52.319 now none of us folks like to see another
00:48:54.680 star so we'll feed you our El so you got

00:49:10.520 up in the
00:49:12.319 hosal well that old cat growled and
00:49:16.559 barked a bit but he saw I meant some
00:49:19.400 serious business and that I weren't
00:49:21.839 scared of him one wit so he turned it
00:49:24.920 over a piece and then agreed
00:49:27.440 but one thing but rabbit added we got to
00:49:31.400 feed him three times a
00:49:33.559 day at this a big Roar praise rose up
00:49:37.720 from the crowd and everyone talked about
00:49:40.040 how Brave Bird rabbit was but after a
00:49:43.559 minute The Hub bub died down and a few
00:49:46.319 folks started wondering aloud where the
00:49:48.520 meat would come from and who was going
00:49:50.680 to feed boss Lon
00:49:54.319 first well wouldn't you know it they all
00:49:57.599 started yammering and quarreling and
00:50:00.280 pointing and screaming at each other you
00:50:02.680 first you first so bur rabbit held up
00:50:06.520 his paw again and suggested they draw
00:50:09.000 straws bur rabbit just happened to have
00:50:11.880 a few straws in his back pocket so he
00:50:14.960 held them in his fist and all the folks
00:50:17.440 Drew
00:50:20.480 straws now it come to pass that ber
00:50:23.280 Goose picked the short one and when he
00:50:26.280 saw
00:50:27.200 he hemmed and hul and honked out like
00:50:29.960 nope nope nope and B rabbit says yep yep
00:50:34.559 yep and pointed in the direction of Boss
00:50:37.119 Lion's cave on the outskirts of
00:50:39.740 [Music]
00:50:41.960 town so bero hung his beak low and
00:50:45.520 headed out to boss Lion's
00:50:49.119 cave stopping at home first to cook an
00:50:52.160 omelette for Boss
00:50:54.599 lion and when he got to boss Lion's cave
00:50:57.880 it was just about Twilight which is to
00:51:00.520 say supper
00:51:03.119 time and boss Li gobbled up bird goose
00:51:06.760 and ate the omelet for
00:51:08.210 [Music]
00:51:11.520 dessert the next morning Bird rabbit
00:51:14.480 held the straws
00:51:16.119 again and this time bird Pig drew the
00:51:19.559 short one and when he saw it he squealed
00:51:22.640 and screamed and OED out l no no no
00:51:30.160 and Bird rabbit said yep yep yep and
00:51:33.160 pointed in the direction of Boss L's
00:51:34.960 cave on the outskirts of
00:51:37.640 town so bird Pig hung his head low and
00:51:41.760 made his way to boss Lion's CID stopping
00:51:44.720 first at home to get a milkshake for
00:51:47.200 Boss
00:51:48.030 [Music]
00:51:50.440 lion and when he got the boss Lion's
00:51:52.760 cave it was breakfast time and boss lion
00:51:56.200 ate bird Pig right up and use the
00:51:58.799 milkshake to shampoo his
00:52:02.110 [Music]
00:52:03.760 hair and so it went on like this at each
00:52:08.079 feeding time for a couple of days with
00:52:11.040 bir folks going out to feed Boss line
00:52:13.720 and never coming back
00:52:15.770 [Music]
00:52:19.240 again and on the third day at lunchtime
00:52:23.520 B Fox up and made an announcement it's
00:52:26.920 my turn now the ho
00:52:33.319 straws he peered over at bur rabid and a
00:52:37.359 thin smile of satisfaction spread across
00:52:40.799 his face he had been watching bir rabbit
00:52:43.799 and realized that as long as bir rabbit
00:52:46.839 held the straws he would send everybody
00:52:49.720 else to feed B slide except himself so
00:52:53.559 when B Fox held the straws that
00:52:55.920 afternoon sure enough bir rabbit picked
00:52:58.839 the short one when bur rabbit saw his
00:53:02.240 straw he didn't hear a ha or honk
00:53:06.280 instead he grew pale and pensive and
00:53:10.319 said it out loud to no one in
00:53:13.920 particular
00:53:15.920 well if that ain't the cat's tail
00:53:19.160 itself I'm pickled bunny in the
00:53:22.839 barrels and then he hopped up on an old
00:53:26.040 tree trunk cleared his throat and
00:53:28.640 addressed his fellow
00:53:32.760 Critters
00:53:34.480 Critters he said we sure had some good
00:53:39.920 times together some laughs some cries
00:53:43.520 some close
00:53:44.880 calls but now it looks like my time is
00:53:48.839 up and I suppose I'm aiming to be an
00:53:51.359 appetizer for that old lion so pray for
00:53:55.040 me folks and perhaps soon we're all meet
00:53:57.920 in that Big Fish Hole in the
00:54:01.160 Sky goodbye ladies goodbye
00:54:06.119 gentlemen and goodbye bir
00:54:11.280 Fox and he hung his head Mighty low and
00:54:15.040 walked out of the village into the leafy
00:54:17.960 cool of the
00:54:20.599 afternoon and all those folks were so
00:54:23.680 moved that tears began rolling down
00:54:26.760 their
00:54:29.520 faces now Bird rabbit was in no
00:54:32.319 considerable rush to get the boss Lion's
00:54:34.640 cave so he decided to make a detour and
00:54:37.920 see his farm for the very last
00:54:41.599 time he took off through the woods and
00:54:44.319 when he arrived there he looked over his
00:54:47.319 car
00:54:50.119 patch goodbye carrot patch he said
00:54:54.240 waving to the green shoots of carrot in
00:54:56.599 the ground he saw a shovel and said
00:54:59.640 goodbye to
00:55:01.000 it I'm shoving off myself Mr sh nice to
00:55:06.079 have work with

00:55:11.799 goodbye and take a last drink of Sweet
00:55:16.839 Water farewell trusty
00:55:19.880 well he said and saw his reflection in
00:55:24.240 the bottom of the well
00:55:27.440 and when he saw his
00:55:29.480 reflection he got such a good idea that
00:55:33.319 he yelled out
00:55:35.240 loud yes sir you are a farewell cuz you
00:55:39.920 always looking out for my
00:55:43.030 [Music]

00:55:48.520 tippity top like the wind itself to boss
00:55:51.079 Lion's
00:55:51.720 [Music]
00:55:54.000 cave by the time he got to the
00:55:57.079 it was getting on toward
00:55:59.839 evening the sun was setting behind the
00:56:02.400 cotton woods and the evening swallow
00:56:04.799 were in the
00:56:06.720 air lunch had long passed and Boss line

00:56:43.000 were about to pounce on bir rabbit and
00:56:45.319 Gobble him up right there so B rabbit
00:56:47.880 had to do some mighty licky split fast

00:57:20.240 through the woods to bur rabbit's farm
00:57:23.359 when they reached bur rabbit's well he
00:57:26.280 opened the door looked in and fell
00:57:29.280 backwards as if he was stung by a
00:57:31.680 honeybee Lord Almighty he yelled to boss

00:57:37.920 he eating your

00:57:44.839 and stuck his head in the
00:57:46.960 well who are you he growled down into
00:57:51.520 the deep well and a few seconds later
00:57:54.839 his Echo came back up
00:57:57.440 who are
00:58:01.440 you now old boss line was not used to
00:58:04.799 being talked back to seeing he was the

00:58:38.960 Red with rage huffing and sarting and
00:58:43.039 growling and just then Bird rabbit poked
00:58:46.520 him in the S you hear him Sashu he said
00:58:51.760 that Lon down there is eating your meat
00:58:55.760 and making a mockery out of you you

00:59:06.039 whoop that lion down there myself if he
00:59:08.680 has the guts to get up here boss lion
00:59:11.760 looked into the well again and saw a
00:59:14.119 lion staring right back up at him a mean
00:59:18.520 and ugly lion and he yelled at it I'm
00:59:22.280 going to get you and it yelled directly
00:59:25.599 back at on SL I'm going to get

00:59:36.640 could
00:59:37.480 handle step back rabbit that cat's dead
00:59:41.799 meat and with that boss lion took a
00:59:45.000 flying leap right into that
00:59:47.760 wh there was a great crash deep inside
00:59:52.000 could
00:59:53.240 plunge and as soon as bir rabbit Hur he
00:59:56.520 slammed the LI shut and locked
00:59:58.500 [Music]
01:00:01.480 it after a few seconds of Silence he
01:00:05.119 took out his
01:00:06.440 cap cocked it on his head and pulled out
01:00:10.200 his old
01:00:12.480 cigar and he SED off into town at a
01:00:16.039 leisurely Pace while the last SPS of
01:00:19.240 sunlight was softening over the
01:00:24.960 forest
01:00:26.799 when he got near the village all the
01:00:28.880 folks was standing around debating who
01:00:31.640 was going to feed boss lion
01:00:35.839 next and when they saw Bird rabbit
01:00:38.400 coming down the road in the Glo they
01:00:40.880 thought for sure he was Ghost and
01:00:42.680 started running to save their
01:00:45.599 souls but Bird rabbit stopped them and
