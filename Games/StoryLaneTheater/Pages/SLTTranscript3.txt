00:00:50.480 come on
00:00:52.000 in settle
00:00:54.359 back it's curtain time at the story lane
00:00:57.800 theater you've never seen a stage like
00:01:00.280 this
00:01:01.320 one anything can happen
00:01:17.080 here today we're going to take a journey
00:01:19.520 with the son of a chief in the African
00:01:21.600 folk tale called koi and the cola nuts
00:01:25.280 but before we set off we're going to
00:01:27.360 visit with the artist who did the
00:01:28.880 pictures you'll see in the show his name
00:01:31.640 is Reynold Ruffins and he lives on Long
00:01:34.200 Island not far from New York City he's
00:01:37.200 been drawing almost his whole life and
00:01:39.439 today he makes art for things like books
00:01:41.520 and magazines he's going to tell us what
00:01:44.240 it's like to be an artist and how he
00:01:46.360 made the pictures for Koy and the cola
00:01:49.560 nuts I've always lived in New
00:01:52.079 York I worked in
00:01:54.759 Manhattan but the last few years I have
00:01:58.159 come out to Long Island it's much
00:02:00.600 quieter and for the first time I had my
00:02:04.159 own Studio arranged pretty much the way
00:02:07.159 I would like it to
00:02:09.119 be and I'm surrounded by the things that
00:02:11.800 I like do dads and knickknacks and and
00:02:15.400 little things that I can't throw
00:02:18.120 out I love masks they're just beautiful
00:02:21.599 beautiful
00:02:26.150 [Music]
00:02:27.400 art the greatest thing about being an
00:02:29.560 artist is I think being able to
00:02:33.000 see light on a leaf uh water in a glass
00:02:37.480 um a sense of the time of day the
00:02:39.920 quality of light um the way Shadows Fall
00:02:44.159 in the corner of a room just somehow
00:02:47.760 being
00:02:49.519 observant it enters Through Your Eyes
00:02:52.440 gets knocked around in your head and and
00:02:55.560 scream through all the experiences
00:02:57.480 you've had but it's but it's it's
00:02:59.640 getting
00:03:00.360 OT down and through your body and out
00:03:03.280 out out your hands it makes it
00:03:12.360 real when I was first asked to do Cody
00:03:16.159 and the colon nuts I thought what a
00:03:18.480 wonderful idea it takes place in an
00:03:21.480 interesting setting in
00:03:24.760 Africa when I was a child I never saw
00:03:28.480 any depiction of African-American
00:03:32.080 children so I welcome the opportunity to
00:03:35.120 create images of life in Africa and to
00:03:39.120 share that image with all
00:03:42.280 children Africa being very big and
00:03:45.480 diverse place I went to the library and
00:03:48.280 I've got many books about African
00:03:50.920 architecture uh uh animals foliage that
00:03:54.680 you might find there that I referred to
00:03:57.040 and then changed and designed in order
00:03:59.439 to make what I thought was a more
00:04:01.280 interesting uh
00:04:05.400 visual I made several sketches for Koy
00:04:08.920 and I wanted him to be both young and
00:04:12.319 distinguished uh a little Hoy and able
00:04:15.799 to still keep his personality when times
00:04:18.279 didn't go well for
00:04:20.040 him ideas can come from wide variety of
00:04:23.320 of places and he in particular I think
00:04:26.280 grew out of uh my interest in masks
00:04:30.960 masks I tried to stylize his features
00:04:34.520 the large eyes long nose so that they
00:04:37.680 would be a connection to the uh
00:04:42.919 masks there are so many things to think
00:04:45.400 about when doing a large piece of work
00:04:47.240 like this you have to plan it out have
00:04:48.720 to make sketches and I make a drawing
00:04:52.800 first what I want to do is transfer this
00:04:56.560 finished sketch to this piece of brown
00:04:59.199 paper I'll do that by using a little
00:05:01.160 tracing paper so the line will be
00:05:05.080 transferred from the
00:05:07.120 tissue onto the colored paper that I'm
00:05:09.479 working on in this case it'll be a nice
00:05:11.199 brown colored
00:05:14.759 paper I'll put in the
00:05:17.039 details you know that's not realistic
00:05:19.479 but it represents hair
00:05:23.120 texture I can add color where that's
00:05:28.080 necessary this is a pattern or design
00:05:30.680 it's often seen in in African art as
00:05:33.960 kind of black and white
00:05:35.970 [Music]
00:05:38.360 triangles let's give you a little
00:05:40.360 character Co eyes reveal so
00:05:46.360 much this is a scene of K talking to the
00:05:50.319 ant that he's met along the way I have
00:05:53.160 his eyes focused on the ant because he's
00:05:55.840 small he's got to get close and he has
00:05:58.479 something to say
00:06:00.560 I want them to look concerned and
00:06:03.560 interested just darken some areas to
00:06:06.240 give features and
00:06:08.240 expression look pretty good
00:06:11.960 now now what I do is going to cut this
00:06:15.360 out very carefully watching the
00:06:19.840 line there we are just about done you're
00:06:23.599 coming Al life
00:06:25.080 [Music]
00:06:27.199 Co now that I finished cutting it out
00:06:29.639 now I added to other elements of
00:06:33.000 the story and using these cutouts I'm
00:06:36.599 able to arrange and rearrange figures in
00:06:40.120 different scenes now this is a night
00:06:42.440 scene so I made this the moon big moon
00:06:46.840 to give it scale palm tree and Co he's
00:06:51.360 very concerned talking to the ants how
00:06:54.160 about you're so sad Co we'll have a few
00:06:58.520 tears
00:07:00.120 that's a nice composition for that how's
00:07:02.599 that Co you like that you'll feel better
00:07:04.919 later you'll see it all comes out okay
00:07:07.680 in the end I
00:07:10.880 [Music]
00:07:13.360 know like many other Fair Tales koi and
00:07:17.039 the colon nuts is a test someone is
00:07:20.280 being tested for their
00:07:22.360 ability KO learned that if you're
00:07:25.319 helpful to others if you're kind to
00:07:27.080 others without being asked to be if you
00:07:30.639 do good because you see that it's
00:07:32.840 necessary that good will come back to
00:07:35.160 you and that being good is its own
00:07:37.960 reward and somehow if you're good good
00:07:41.199 will return to
00:07:43.420 [Music]

00:09:05.839 Africa it is dawn in the west of
00:09:09.839 Africa and the Sun is a big orange red
00:09:13.440 ball slowly rising over the
00:09:17.000 horizon feel the warm breeze that
00:09:22.120 blows the rains have just come and the
00:09:25.040 Earth is full of
00:09:28.360 promise flowers bloom and banana trees
00:09:31.160 bear
00:09:32.880 fruit and the yams and rice grow well in
00:09:35.680 the
00:09:37.480 fields smell the beautiful
00:09:43.440 [Music]
00:09:46.279 fragrances look the animals gather at
00:09:49.480 the
00:09:53.600 river far in the distance there is a
00:09:58.040 village with smoke from the cooking
00:10:00.360 fires makes a trail in the
00:10:04.240 sky
00:10:06.760 listen you can hear the sound of the
00:10:12.920 drums the drums spread the news that the
00:10:16.120 chief of a village has
00:10:19.130 [Music]
00:10:23.240 died all of the people and all of the
00:10:26.040 animals from miles around hear the
00:10:28.000 message of the drums
00:10:33.079 Chief Sedaka is
00:10:35.900 [Music]
00:10:39.680 dead a pver that's a meeting is called
00:10:44.160 and all the Elders of the village
00:10:45.880 gathered to decide what to do they
00:10:48.920 decide that the wisest man of the
00:10:50.839 village will divide the chief's
00:10:52.639 possessions among the chief's
00:10:54.639 Sons so the wise man counts out to each
00:10:58.399 of the sons so many goats so many cows
00:11:02.720 so many tusks of Ivory and so many
00:11:05.279 pieces of gold the wise man
00:11:11.639 finishes But Here Comes Koy the chief's
00:11:14.959 youngest

00:11:23.440 possessions there's nothing left for koi
00:11:26.440 not even a tiny chicken
00:11:28.240 bone
00:11:31.240 since this wise man is wisest when it
00:11:33.600 comes to avoiding work he does not
00:11:35.880 bother to redivide the chief's
00:11:37.600 possessions no it's too much

00:30:44.960 feast and now the story is
00:30:56.919 over



00:33:26.760 for
00:33:34.600 come on
00:33:36.080 in settle
00:33:38.399 back it's curtain time at the story lane
00:33:41.880 theater you've never seen a stage like
00:33:44.320 this
00:33:45.399 one anything can happen
00:33:55.310 [Applause]
00:33:56.720 here
00:34:02.279 today's story is called Mo's the fireman
00:34:05.519 it takes place in the 1800s in New York
00:34:08.199 City New York was a much different place
00:34:11.000 back then most of the buildings were
00:34:13.119 made of wood so in crowded neighborhoods
00:34:15.639 fires could be a big problem and that's
00:34:18.639 where Mo's fit in but before we get to
00:34:21.359 Moose's story we're going to stop off at
00:34:23.760 this Old Firehouse once known as engine
00:34:26.560 company number 30 and now known as the
00:34:29.280 New York City fire Museum the man you
00:34:32.280 see inside the museum is Don Cannon he's
00:34:35.320 a volunteer fireman a historian and an
00:34:38.359 expert on the ways people have fought
00:34:40.159 fires from the beginning of History to
00:34:42.199 the
00:34:43.960 present I've always felt that fighting
00:34:46.918 fires and studying and learning how to
00:34:49.239 discipline myself and learning how to
00:34:50.800 work with others and going through all
00:34:52.719 the tough times in the street and in
00:34:54.879 buildings it's kind of like the price of
00:34:56.639 admission to a community of people who
00:34:59.839 you really know are good
00:35:03.040 people all firefighters are supposed to
00:35:05.160 work in teams you need each other to
00:35:06.920 stay alive you're working together
00:35:08.880 towards a common objective and you each
00:35:10.640 depend on the other to complete the task
00:35:14.359 together for any firefighter the height
00:35:17.000 of his or her career would be to save a
00:35:20.599 life and they can go on with their lives
00:35:22.880 and live a good life
00:35:26.640 themselves
00:35:27.720 [Music]
00:35:33.720 I was really delighted the first time
00:35:35.119 that I read the story of Mose he was
00:35:37.400 such an
00:35:38.880 attractive figure to
00:35:41.040 me tough Rough and Ready hard of gold
00:35:45.599 loyal
00:35:47.880 energetic Mo represented a stereotype of
00:35:51.560 the the bowy
00:35:54.960 boy the newly arrived brash immigrant
00:35:58.359 type and they were looked down upon by a
00:36:00.839 lot of people as being a crude a bunch
00:36:03.599 of
00:36:05.560 Ruffians but he demonstrated and he
00:36:08.359 represented to the to the larger
00:36:09.960 community that these are good people
00:36:11.599 that they loved the city in their own
00:36:13.760 way and they would risk their lives to
00:36:16.440 protect their
00:36:19.560 neighborhoods when fires broke out in
00:36:21.680 Moses day the firefighters would be
00:36:23.880 awakened by the deep deep sound of the
00:36:28.079 tower bells in the district where the
00:36:30.520 fire
00:36:31.400 originated Moses experience is very
00:36:35.000 common snug a bed aroused by the bells
00:36:39.079 of the fire alarm Tower jumping into his
00:36:43.560 pants and boots neatly laid by the side
00:36:47.800 of his bed going out into the cold dark
00:36:51.720 running hearing the footsteps of other
00:36:53.440 volunteers running to the Firehouse
00:36:55.040 pulling this thousand PB hand pumping
00:36:57.040 engine
00:36:58.319 exhausted racing to the fire and then
00:37:00.240 they had to find either a pond or a
00:37:03.240 stream and Connect into it through a
00:37:05.560 hydrant or a plug with their leather
00:37:08.000 hoses and start pumping and each company
00:37:11.480 tried to be the first engine in at a
00:37:15.599 fire and the honor of putting first
00:37:18.480 water on a fire was uh a great one at
00:37:21.440 that
00:37:23.040 point fireman Mo would have looked at
00:37:26.560 his world in much the same way that
00:37:29.960 firefighters do
00:37:35.359 today I think that the people you work
00:37:38.400 with or people he worked with were
00:37:41.040 closely uh
00:37:44.760 connected they shared uh experiences
00:37:47.839 evoked the same kind of passionate
00:37:50.720 loyalty and affection that fire
00:37:53.040 companies do in Baltimore or Pittsburgh
00:37:56.040 or or Chicago
00:38:00.079 today I really think that whatever the
00:38:03.560 time whatever the place I think there's
00:38:06.880 a a real understanding that uh rises
00:38:10.760 above time rises above
00:38:14.319 place there's a shared respect for life
00:38:18.000 and for each other and for
00:38:19.800 people the sum total of everybody
00:38:21.880 working together is quite
00:38:26.440 astonishing
00:38:28.000 thanks for your thoughts Don and now
00:38:30.680 let's watch the story of Mo the
00:38:34.850 [Music]
00:38:54.070 [Applause]
00:38:56.440 fireman
00:39:01.660 [Music]
00:39:26.359 yeah
00:39:36.680 excuse me excuse me I hate to botherers
00:39:41.280 but I just wanted to ask you if by any
00:39:44.280 chance you'd ever heard of a guy by the
00:39:46.040 name of Mose the fireman Moses humph was
00:39:49.839 his real name and he was the greatest
00:39:51.720 firefighter who ever lived this is going
00:39:54.200 way back now in fact this goes so far
00:39:56.880 back that New York City was so new it
00:39:58.800 still had a price tag on it but
00:40:00.720 seriously this is a long long time ago
00:40:03.920 it's even before Subways was
00:40:12.800 invented now to begin at the beginning
00:40:15.839 MOS humph was born in 1809 in a tenement
00:40:18.800 on the Lower East Side of New York the
00:40:21.160 same year Abraham Lincoln was born in a
00:40:23.520 log cabin on the plains of
00:40:26.319 Illinois
00:40:31.240 anyhow that winter there was a big fire
00:40:33.680 in New York every fireman in the city
00:40:36.480 was there trying to put it out it burned
00:40:39.240 all through the night destroying block
00:40:41.200 after block of wooden
00:40:44.240 houses it was very sad you see they
00:40:47.800 didn't have too many fire plugs at that
00:40:49.599 time so they had to pump the water right
00:40:51.680 out of whatever River or Pond or paddle
00:40:54.359 or whatever was close
00:40:56.240 by
00:40:57.960 anyhow just as they was putting out the
00:41:00.040 last fire there was a big explosion
00:41:03.760 boom that blasted the top half of the
00:41:06.440 building into a million
00:41:09.040 pieces now most of it landed in the icy
00:41:11.760 waters of the East River and everyone
00:41:13.599 who had been trapped inside was given up
00:41:15.640 for
00:41:16.450 [Music]
00:41:18.520 dead but not long after that one of the
00:41:21.640 firemen from engine company number 40
00:41:23.680 heard a cry from down by the river and
00:41:26.520 right there lying in a busted hugs head
00:41:30.040 among the Frozen Cattails they found a
00:41:32.920 little redheaded
00:41:36.599 baby well the fireman of number 40
00:41:39.440 decided to adopt the little guy right
00:41:41.319 then and there and because of the way
00:41:43.160 they'd found him they decided to name
00:41:45.000 him Moses after a guy who was also found
00:41:48.200 floating in a river although not in the
00:41:50.200 East River and not in New
00:41:53.200 York and so Moses it was although
00:41:56.560 practically every body just called him
00:42:01.400 Mo and so Mo grew up in a firehouse he
00:42:04.880 took his first bath inside a fire helmet
00:42:07.440 and they used a big coil of hose for his
00:42:09.800 play pen now as you already know
00:42:13.000 firefighting was very primitive
00:42:14.920 operation back in the old days to begin
00:42:17.560 with they had only one piece of
00:42:19.800 equipment called an engine which was
00:42:22.079 really just a big clunky water pump on
00:42:25.559 Wheels and because all the firemen were
00:42:28.160 Volunteers in those days whenever the
00:42:30.079 fire Bell sounded they would all stop
00:42:32.319 whatever they was doing run to the
00:42:34.000 firehouse and haul the old engine out
00:42:36.400 and then they drag it to the fire
00:42:38.480 themselves with ropes which was no piece
00:42:40.640 of cake you see it wasn't until many
00:42:43.319 years later that they figured out they
00:42:45.359 could get horses to do it these guys
00:42:48.440 were not exactly
00:42:50.480 valedictorians pretty soon they'd let Mo
00:42:52.880 ride to the fire with them and he'd
00:42:54.640 watch as the Fire Marshall shouted
00:42:56.319 orders to everybody threw a silver
00:42:58.160 speaking trumpet man the brakes he'd say
00:43:01.960 the brakes were the big handles that
00:43:03.640 pumped the water man the brakes watch
00:43:06.599 that hose there Step Lively boys can the
00:43:10.880 Mongoose and the men would pump up and
00:43:13.599 down on the brakes as fast as they could
00:43:15.960 and this would suck the water out of the
00:43:18.119 wooden pipes that ran along most of the
00:43:20.200 main roads and shoot it out the other
00:43:22.599 end it was hard
00:43:26.119 work
00:43:32.760 well Mo grew up fast and pretty soon he
00:43:35.599 was right in there with him hauling the
00:43:37.640 engine and not long after that he was so
00:43:40.000 big and strong that that just let him
00:43:41.720 pull it all by
00:43:45.000 himself now the engine at company number
00:43:47.599 40 was called lady Washington as
00:43:49.760 Georgia's wife and there wasn't a more
00:43:52.000 beautiful piece of equipment
00:43:56.040 anywhere and whenever the firebell
00:43:58.240 sounded moose was always the first one
00:44:00.440 ready to holler off you see Mose was
00:44:03.559 never want to fool around with the
00:44:04.880 stairs he just throw his boots out the
00:44:06.720 window and take a flying leap right
00:44:08.640 after them putting them on as he fell
00:44:10.839 and Landing without a hitch it got where
00:44:13.400 he could jump out the window shave comb
00:44:16.079 his hair brush his teeth eat some
00:44:17.800 oatmeal read three chapters of a good
00:44:19.960 book drink some coffee but that spilling
00:44:22.280 a drop moose is some kind of
00:44:26.040 fireman
00:44:29.680 now I wouldn't want to give you the idea
00:44:32.200 that Mo and the bowy boys of company
00:44:34.240 number 40 were the only ones fighting
00:44:36.280 fires in New York there were fire
00:44:37.920 companies all over this city and every
00:44:39.880 company thought their engine was the
00:44:41.440 best so I guess you could say they had a
00:44:43.640 little rivalry going on between
00:44:48.680 them whenever a fire alarm went off
00:44:51.400 three or four companies were all raced
00:44:53.160 to the fire at once hoping to be the one
00:44:54.960 to tap the fire plug and have the arm of
00:44:57.319 holding the hose and toting out the
00:45:04.200 fire one time two companies got into a
00:45:06.960 brawl over a plug while the very fire
00:45:09.480 they should have been putting out
00:45:10.720 continued to
00:45:12.880 burn now Mo and syy who is Moose's best
00:45:16.520 pal couldn't believe what they were
00:45:18.280 seeing they had to do something who
00:45:20.520 needs a fire plug anyway Mo shouted come
00:45:23.359 on sey let's
00:45:25.960 go so Mo grabbed the pickaxe and just
00:45:29.319 made a hole in the pipe itself syy take
00:45:32.839 the butt he shouted syy grabbed the
00:45:35.559 nozzle and pointed it at the fire and
00:45:37.599 then Mo stuck the other end right into
00:45:39.720 the hole he made in the water pipe and
00:45:41.480 began pumping the engine breaks all by
00:45:45.040 himself the water shot out with such
00:45:47.280 force that the fire was out in no time
00:45:49.359 and syy had a hose down the brawling
00:45:51.319 companies just so he could tell him to
00:45:53.400 go home that cool him off
00:45:57.320 [Music]
00:46:03.280 now as you probably already figured out
00:46:05.280 the Bowery was kind of a wacko
00:46:10.960 place there were live pigs running wild
00:46:13.800 through the streets rooting around to
00:46:15.440 eat whatever scraps of food they could
00:46:17.400 find and whenever you turned there were
00:46:19.440 chimney sweeps and vendors of all kinds
00:46:21.720 selling onions and whatnot and there
00:46:23.760 were guys with carts that sold steaming
00:46:26.319 hot yam HS and fresh apples and baked PE
00:46:29.280 dripping with syrup I'm getting hungry
00:46:31.800 just thinking about it somebody run down
00:46:34.559 and get me a
00:46:36.920 canoli and each of these characters
00:46:39.040 would have a song that they would sing
00:46:40.920 like the guy who Soul claims would sing
00:46:43.520 my claims I want to sell today the best
00:46:45.880 claims from a rock away
00:46:52.920 hey but the most popular street food of
00:46:55.800 them all was the boiled ears of corn
00:46:58.400 that were carried in Cedar buckets by
00:47:00.720 the white corn gals of the
00:47:06.400 bowy well one day as Mo was swaggering
00:47:09.400 down the bowy with syy he spotted a
00:47:11.960 white corn gown Nam
00:47:14.720 lies and it might be a corny way of
00:47:17.160 putting it but when she sang her voice
00:47:19.720 was as sweet as the corn she
00:47:24.000 sold hot corn hot corn his your Lily
00:47:27.680 white corn all you that's got money po
00:47:30.880 me that's got none buy my Lily white
00:47:33.559 corn and let me go home what an attitude
00:47:37.880 but hey this is New York we're talking
00:47:39.599 about besides sewed corn am I
00:47:45.400 right well what can I say MOS was Gaga
00:47:48.880 head over heels in
00:47:51.119 love now the natural thing for a power
00:47:53.839 boy to do when he was in love was to ask
00:47:56.119 his G to go to to fireman's ball with
00:47:57.880 him but somehow Mo just couldn't get up
00:48:00.040 the nerve you see without some big scary
00:48:03.760 fire roaring around them moose was as
00:48:06.359 shy as could
00:48:08.640 be and so he just buy some corn and be
00:48:11.920 on his
00:48:15.760 way well pretty soon the fireman's ball
00:48:18.760 is right around the corner and mo still
00:48:20.480 has an
00:48:21.440 [Music]
00:48:24.240 as but lucky for Mo they was a big fire
00:48:27.640 over on Delany
00:48:30.200 street that was some Blaze all right the
00:48:32.880 flame shot way up over the top of a
00:48:34.760 four-story building which was the
00:48:36.280 tallest building there was in New York
00:48:37.880 at that time and it presented some real
00:48:40.079 problems for the firemen because they
00:48:41.839 didn't have ladds that could get up that
00:48:44.220 [Music]
00:48:48.319 high but M was on the scene in The Flash
00:48:51.040 with the B boys at number 40 right
00:48:53.079 behind
00:48:53.730 [Music]
00:48:55.240 them the building was covered in flames
00:48:57.960 and it looked like it was going to
00:48:59.040 collapse at any minute then all of a
00:49:02.280 sudden they hear his voice calling for
00:49:07.640 help and then Mo saw her on the fourth
00:49:11.200 floor right through the burnning
00:49:13.440 Flames it was lies his white corn
00:49:18.000 gal without even stopping to think he
00:49:20.640 ran over to a ship Builder's joint and
00:49:22.559 grabbed the tallest ship's mast he could
00:49:24.880 find then like the lunatic that he was
00:49:28.359 he sprinted toward the burning building
00:49:30.480 and pole vaulted right up to the fourth
00:49:34.160 floor well what with all those Flames
00:49:36.799 roaring around him M felt like his usual
00:49:39.119 Brave self so then and there on the
00:49:41.280 window seal with a building about to
00:49:43.400 collapse and the fire so hot that they
00:49:45.920 were both sweating bullets Mo asked Li
00:49:49.680 if she'd go to the fireman's ball with
00:49:52.839 him well what's she going to say I'd
00:49:56.319 love to she said and that was
00:50:03.079 that that's all M needed to hear he was
00:50:07.319 so happy he couldn't contain himself he
00:50:09.440 grabbed lies and was just about to jump
00:50:11.319 out the window with her but then he
00:50:12.880 realized he should probably do something
00:50:15.720 a little more civilized what with her
00:50:18.079 being a real lady and all so holding on
00:50:21.640 the lies with his right arm and the
00:50:23.520 ship's mask with the other he slid all
00:50:26.400 the down to the ground it was a straight
00:50:28.640 shot no
00:50:31.599 traffic oh by the way that's how the
00:50:34.040 fire pole was invented I bet you didn't
00:50:36.200 know that did you you probably thought
00:50:38.559 it was Ben Franklin or Tom Addison who
00:50:40.799 invented it didn't you well it was Mo
00:50:43.280 who did it and if photography had been
00:50:45.640 popular then I'd showed you pictures to
00:50:47.559 prove
00:50:50.359 it well it wasn't long before the
00:50:52.599 fireman ball rolled around moose got all
00:50:54.599 gussied up for it although no baly boy
00:50:57.480 ever went anywhere without wearing his
00:50:59.000 red flann on fire shirt you see you
00:51:01.200 could never tell when there was going to
00:51:02.640 be a fire and you had to be prepared but
00:51:05.319 because of his love for lies Mo put on a
00:51:08.040 white Dicky over the top of it very
00:51:10.920 classy of course lies didn't look so bad
00:51:13.599 herself she was a site for sore I the
00:51:16.960 two of them danced all through the
00:51:19.920 night it was Moses dream come
00:51:24.200 true well Mose wasn't to waste time and
00:51:28.079 after a couple of hours of dancing with
00:51:29.760 lies he was all set to propose marriage
00:51:32.640 that's all there was to it so he wiped
00:51:34.799 his mouth and his sleeve and he cleared
00:51:36.599 his
00:51:37.640 throat and he said lies will you but
00:51:42.599 just as he was getting to the point Mo
00:51:44.799 heard a distant sound a bell coming from
00:51:48.359 the direction of City Hall being the
00:51:51.040 remarkable fireman that he was he could
00:51:52.920 hear it over all the music that the
00:51:54.599 orchestra was playing fire Mo shouted
00:51:57.680 with all his might fire turn out boys
00:52:00.319 turn
00:52:01.119 out with that every man in the place
00:52:03.920 dropped whatever he was doing and ran
00:52:05.839 for the nearest
00:52:07.520 exit but by the time they got to the
00:52:09.880 fire it had already burned several
00:52:13.280 blocks it was the worst fire in New York
00:52:15.640 had ever seen every single company in
00:52:18.559 the city was there Mo was up and down L
00:52:21.920 as rescuing people all through the
00:52:24.680 night but it was a losing battle it just
00:52:27.960 wasn't enough water and the fire
00:52:30.400 continued to burn out of
00:52:35.319 control after a while it began to look
00:52:38.359 completely hopeless Mo side the saddest
00:52:42.680 sigh ever
00:52:44.920 side Gotham would never be the
00:52:50.839 same from where he was most could see a
00:52:53.640 Hudson River at the edge of the island
00:52:55.920 it was also so sad all that water and no
00:53:00.079 way to get it to the
00:53:04.640 fire but then suddenly Mo lunatic that
00:53:09.480 he was got a crazy idea a cocking nutso
00:53:14.000 wacko idea although somehow the more he
00:53:16.520 thought about it the less nuts it seemed
00:53:19.079 without a moment to waste Mo jumped down
00:53:21.000 to the ground and grabbed the biggest
00:53:22.240 shovel he could find then he rolled up
00:53:24.599 his sleeves and started digging a hole
00:53:26.200 in the general direction of New Jersey
00:53:28.760 sexy just looked at him hey this ain't
00:53:31.240 no time for chasing groundhogs he said
00:53:33.280 for crying out loud what's in matter
00:53:35.119 with you The Whole Town's burning down
00:53:38.000 but by that time moose was already under
00:53:39.839 theground and headed Due West hey moose
00:53:43.160 syy shouted hey where you going what do
00:53:45.799 you think he shouted back to get
00:53:49.240 water well that's all mo had to say he
00:53:52.319 always kept his word and syy knew Mo
00:53:54.480 would be back with water just like he
00:53:56.200 said
00:53:58.599 in a little while practically everybody
00:54:00.440 in town was standing there looking into
00:54:02.040 the hole and just waiting for Mo to
00:54:06.280 reappear then suddenly there was a loud
00:54:10.720 pop followed by the sound like a tidal
00:54:13.280 wave might make and then
00:54:16.720 kabo upshot Mo like a spoked fish with a
00:54:19.960 Hudson River right behind
00:54:21.300 [Music]
00:54:23.599 them then without wasting a second most
00:54:26.400 picked up lady Washington all by himself
00:54:28.799 and wedged her into the hole as tight as
00:54:31.359 possible all right everybody he said
00:54:34.359 we're going to have to work together
00:54:35.760 hook every hose up to lady Washington
00:54:37.799 don't nobody Crow around there's enough
00:54:39.400 H2O for everyone he use bums and hurry
00:54:41.799 it up cuz there ain't much
00:54:43.559 time well every company did as they were
00:54:46.359 told and the minute all the hoses were
00:54:48.040 hooked up most started pumping the
00:54:50.160 brakes he was moving so fast it looked
00:54:52.680 like a blur on top of a blur on top of a
00:54:55.319 hallucination
00:54:57.720 but then all of a sudden it happened
00:55:00.319 water began to shoot out of all those
00:55:01.880 hoses at once and the pressure in each
00:55:03.520 hose was so unbelievable that it took
00:55:05.680 every single man in each company just to
00:55:07.760 keep him under
00:55:08.850 [Music]
00:55:12.000 control in fact there was so much water
00:55:14.760 coming out of those hoses that the fire
00:55:16.559 didn't know which way to turn it just
00:55:18.599 freaked out I guess you could say that
00:55:20.920 the fire had met its match who got it
00:55:25.119 well MO continu pumping The Brak so fast
00:55:27.480 that in no time at all every single
00:55:29.440 flame and every last Ember was
00:55:31.319 extinguished by the bang just like that
00:55:34.559 was over Mo had saved New York the whole
00:55:39.079 city erupted with cheese hooray for Mo
00:55:41.920 everyone shouted hooray for the king of
00:55:43.760 the bowy B has done it
00:55:46.340 [Music]
00:55:49.440 again now of course this was true but Mo
00:55:53.319 was a very humble guy he couldn't stand
00:55:55.680 being the same of attention I'm just
00:55:57.960 doing my duty he said you see when
00:56:01.400 you're as much of a hero as Mo was you
00:56:04.000 do stuff like drain the Hudson River
00:56:05.720 without blinking it's just what you
00:56:08.799 do well people kept on cheering and the
00:56:11.920 noise was so loud that Mo had a scream
00:56:14.520 as marriage proposal to li who screamed
00:56:17.079 back her answer which was absolutely
00:56:19.520 yeah definitely no question about it yes
00:56:23.559 and since everybody was already dressed
00:56:25.079 for the occas they went back up to the
00:56:27.039 Firehouse for the wedding and that was
00:56:28.720 that but a bing
00:56:31.040 [Music]
00:56:37.559 married oh by the way after Mo had
00:56:40.599 gotten through over the Hudson it took
00:56:42.280 so long to fill back up that for weeks
00:56:44.960 you could just walk right over to Jersey
00:56:47.160 which is not the brightest idea in the
00:56:48.640 world but hey it's free country you want
00:56:50.480 to go to Jersey go to
00:56:54.079 Jersey and that's for the tunnel he does
00:56:56.280 dug it just kind of sat there for a
00:56:58.559 while but after a couple of years
00:57:01.200 somebody got an idea about putting train
00:57:03.319 tracks down there on account of it would
00:57:05.319 be nice and quiet and out of the way and
00:57:08.039 that's how the Subways came into being
