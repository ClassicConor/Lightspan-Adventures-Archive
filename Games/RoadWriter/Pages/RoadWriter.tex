Road Writer for the PlayStation 1 is one of the only games within the Lightspan Adventures series that exists on its own as its own game, as opposed to as part of a series.
The game is designed to help children to practice and improve their writing skills.
I did not manage to go through much of this game, as it is a game that requires a lot of reading and writing, and therefore I was not able to assess the game in its entirety, and what happens when you complete all sections of the game.
However, it does appear to be one of the few games which allow you to save you progress, in order to continue where you left off.

The game consists of two difficultly settings: Export and Pro.
Depending on the difficulty the player selects, they will have a variety of different locations to explore within the game.

The Expert difficulty setting has the following locations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mount Hans
    \item LaMancha Canyon
    \item Dodgson Creek
    \item New Bronzeville
\end{itemize}

The Pro difficulty setting has the following locations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Canterbury Canyon
    \item Greene Woods
    \item Hamlet Springs
    \item Hughes City
\end{itemize}

For each location, no matter the difficult, the player is able to select from a variety of writing minigames:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Writing Assignment
    \item Prewriting (contains two difficulties: level 1 and level 2)
    \item Revising (contains two difficulties: level 1 and level 2)
    \item Proofreading (locked until the player has completed the other three minigames)
\end{itemize}

\section{Transcriptions}

\subsection{Home Screen - Chaucer}

A globe-trotter, Chaucer's travelled through every continent.
Author of 'It's a Dog's Life', Chaucer is current editor of the very popular 'Dog Year' magazine.

\subsection{Home Screen - Ralph}

An experience political journalist, Ralph has walked with every US presidents dog in office.
A careful and intelligent listener, he has scooped many an unwitting hound by getting the story first, straight from the first dog's kennel.

\subsection{Home Screen - Gwyn}

A poet, short story writer and reporter for the high school paper, Gwyn is alway ready to pick up a new story or a quick game of hoops.
A crusader for human rights, Gwynn is the go-to person, and take the ball hard to the hoop.

\subsection{Home Screen - Miguel}

Whether it's investigating a political coverup, or sleuthing business fraud, Miguel is the champion of integrity.
His goal is to have a Pulitzer Prize by 21, so he races from class to city hall to his privately published newsletter, which he calls 'Don Quixote'.
Count on him to get the news out and let the public decide.

\subsection{Road Writer Song}

Gotta write a story, got something to say,

You're on the right road, gotta say it our way,

Our story unfolds, we're on the right road,

Nobody can see the world exactly like we do,

Nobody can write about like me and you,

Like you,

Gotta think it up, and write it down,

Gotta share it with a friend,

Changing it, rearranging it,

Fine tune it to the end,

Let the story unfold, just get on the right road,

Get going now, get on the move,

Start writing, do it today,

Every road's original, gotta say it all our way,

Gotta see the world exactly like we do,

We're on the right road, the right road
