00:01:39.880 way 1 2 3 go hop who turned off the
00:01:46.320 lights we were just playing around with
00:01:48.320 our umbrellas it was kind of rainy today
00:01:50.240 and everybody brought them in so we were
00:01:51.640 just having a little fun okay everybody
00:01:53.360 time to put your umbrellas back in the
00:01:54.719 closet do you know that you are like an
00:01:57.600 umbrella I mean you don't look look like
00:02:00.119 an umbrella but uh well here's what I
00:02:01.920 mean an umbrella is just a a round piece
00:02:06.200 of cloth that's kind of loose and floppy
00:02:09.239 and it gets its shape because on the
00:02:12.319 inside there are some stiff wires and
00:02:15.000 these wires stretch the cloth out and
00:02:17.239 give the umbrella its umbrella shape
00:02:19.720 well you're the same way you have soft
00:02:22.200 skin on the outside of your body that
00:02:24.440 covers you all over and on the inside
00:02:26.319 you have bones now you can feel a bone
00:02:29.160 just like this hold your arm up and
00:02:31.560 squeeze your arm and just feel around
00:02:33.319 here especially underneath your wrist
00:02:35.560 can you feel something hard in there
00:02:37.959 that hard thing is a bone and it's like
00:02:40.560 the wires in the umbrella it's stiff and
00:02:42.959 it's hard and it gives you some shape
00:02:45.239 now how many of these bones do you think
00:02:46.760 you have in your body 50
00:02:50.519 87 100 more than 200 did any of you
00:02:55.360 guess more than 200 well if you did
00:02:57.560 you're right that's hard to imagine that
00:02:59.400 we have
00:03:00.319 that many bones inside our body I'd like
00:03:02.920 you to meet someone who can show us just
00:03:04.680 how many bones we really do
00:03:08.400 have this is Mr Bones hi Mr Bones nice
00:03:12.840 hat you ever seen one of these it's
00:03:15.239 called a skeleton and a skeleton is a
00:03:17.360 collection of all the bones of an animal
00:03:19.560 or a person who've been put together so
00:03:21.959 that you can see what they look like now
00:03:23.560 this skeleton isn't real it's just made
00:03:25.640 of plastic but it shows you all of the
00:03:27.959 bones that make up the human body
00:03:30.599 now were you already guessing that this
00:03:32.360 was the skeleton of a human body before
00:03:34.200 I told you that I mean look at it does
00:03:36.439 it sort of look like a human there's a
00:03:38.959 head at the top there are some shoulders
00:03:42.000 there's two arms with
00:03:44.360 hands two legs so a skeleton has the
00:03:48.040 same shape that I do and that's one of
00:03:50.599 the things that a skeleton does it gives
00:03:52.599 you your shape now here's another
00:03:54.680 skeleton that has a different kind of
00:03:58.239 shape where do you think think this
00:04:00.040 skeleton came from it doesn't look like
00:04:02.239 a human person so what do you think it
00:04:05.159 is well let's look at it it has four
00:04:07.640 legs see one 2 3
00:04:11.079 four on the ends of the toes are some
00:04:13.640 sharp claws there's a head over here at
00:04:16.639 this end that has some long teeth on it
00:04:19.639 and the back is kind of curved and then
00:04:21.560 there's a long tail over here what do
00:04:23.320 you think this skeleton is from well
00:04:26.400 this is from a cat kind of looks like a
00:04:29.080 cat doesn't it you know when you pet a
00:04:30.520 cat and their back arches up like that
00:04:32.440 it's about the size of a cat so a
00:04:34.240 skeleton gives you a shape I'd like you
00:04:36.600 to meet someone else now this is a very
00:04:38.880 unusual skeleton kind of looks like a
00:04:41.120 paper plate actually it is a paper plate
00:04:44.240 and underneath the paper plate is a
00:04:47.400 friend of mine I'd like you to meet
00:04:49.320 Gertrude the guinea pig hi gertude come
00:04:51.240 on out come on out and say hi to
00:04:53.120 everybody she likes to be scratched
00:04:55.120 right behind the ears just like this
00:04:56.280 don't you right can you see how tiny her
00:05:00.479 feet are and she's talking to us too
00:05:03.120 look at her little tiny claws little
00:05:05.600 tiny feet there she's pointing them out
00:05:07.039 to us gerchard is a small animal so what
00:05:10.720 do you think her skeleton would look
00:05:12.240 like well I have a guinea pig skeleton
00:05:14.880 here here Gerard you just sit right
00:05:16.360 there that's good girl and you can watch
00:05:20.080 here is a guinea pig's head and look at
00:05:24.240 the shape of the skeleton head compared
00:05:26.240 to gertrud's head yeah you agree don't
00:05:28.319 you you see how it has the same shape
00:05:30.960 and look at the front there's some
00:05:32.919 really strange curved teeth here at the
00:05:34.880 front and some more teeth underneath and
00:05:37.120 that's one of the nice things about
00:05:38.280 looking at skeletons you can see what an
00:05:39.800 animal looks like on the inside you
00:05:41.800 can't tell what Gertrude's teeth look
00:05:43.319 like just by looking at her on the
00:05:44.479 outside like this can we yeah here's
00:05:47.000 some other Bones from a guinea
00:05:49.240 pig little tiny they're not very big and
00:05:52.960 they're really light they hardly weigh
00:05:54.479 anything at all and that's because Gert
00:05:56.520 doesn't weigh very much either what do
00:05:58.600 you think it is you doing well Hi Sam

00:06:05.400 I'm looking at Gertrude's skeleton or a
00:06:07.039 guinea pig skeleton and they're really
00:06:08.880 tiny bones aren't they they don't weigh
00:06:10.360 very much can you imagine an animal that
00:06:12.319 has a really large skeleton once I saw a
00:06:15.240 skeleton as big as a car as big as a car

00:07:09.199 place where you can dig for dinosaur
00:07:11.479 bones because that's where people find
00:07:14.120 dinosaur bones in the
00:07:17.199 ground I found something me too I know

00:07:40.120 turtles guess what I have I'll give you
00:07:43.240 a hint it's an animal I'll give you
00:07:45.840 another hint it's the kind that doesn't
00:07:47.560 have any bones give up a worm worms are
00:07:52.080 kind of floppy like and you can almost
00:07:54.440 tell they don't have any bones they
00:07:56.560 aren't stiff and they can't stand up do
00:07:59.720 you ever wonder what it would feel like
00:08:01.599 if you didn't have any
00:08:03.360 bones well Mr Bones can show us all
00:08:06.280 about joints let's start with the elbow
00:08:09.000 joint that I had in my arm here's his
00:08:11.159 arm and you can see that there's a
00:08:12.919 really stiff bone up here A big one
00:08:15.120 that's the top part of the arm and there
00:08:16.879 are some really stiff bones down here
00:08:18.919 that's the bottom part of the arm and
00:08:20.639 where they join together that's the
00:08:22.520 joint that's the part that moves and
00:08:24.680 that's the part that bends at the elbow
00:08:27.400 so that we can do this now there are
00:08:29.680 lots of other joints in Mr Bones here
00:08:31.560 now Arn now what part of your body did
00:08:32.919 you say you could move a neck your neck
00:08:35.159 well look at Mr Bone's neck he's got all
00:08:36.799 kinds of Bones up here and where they
00:08:38.519 join he can move his neck around and
00:08:40.719 Louisa what did you move my hand your
00:08:42.880 hand can we find his hand there it is
00:08:45.240 sure and his hand can go up and down
00:08:46.560 like that how's your hand move that's
00:08:47.800 right and that's where some bones come
00:08:50.120 together so that they can move and Sam
00:08:52.240 what did you move I said I could bend my
00:08:53.880 fingers let's look at Mr Bone's fingers
00:08:56.080 yeah see you move your fingers and where
00:08:58.040 these bones come together
00:09:00.040 they move and those are joints even
00:09:02.120 though the bones themselves are very
00:09:03.800 stiff the joints are where they can bend
00:09:06.200 and that's so that we can bend can you
00:09:07.959 find any other joints in Mr Bone's body
00:09:10.560 one other joint his knees right yeah
00:09:12.480 look he's got two knees where's your
00:09:13.800 knee where's your knee that's this one
00:09:15.839 down here right big joint right there
00:09:19.079 what does this part of the body right
00:09:21.880 here remind you of a cage a cage that's
00:09:25.519 right Arnell and that's because it is a
00:09:27.600 cage and we call it the rib cage all
00:09:30.000 these bones right here and Inside the
00:09:31.880 Cage is one of these you know what this
00:09:35.399 is what it looks
00:09:36.800 like you know it looks like a heart and
00:09:39.839 the human heart looks something like
00:09:41.480 this and it's very soft and very
00:09:43.200 delicate and it could be hurt so to
00:09:45.320 protect it it goes inside the cage so
00:09:47.839 we're going to give Mr Bones a heart and
00:09:50.160 your heart sits right about there and
00:09:52.000 there are some other things in there
00:09:53.279 like lungs and they're very soft and so
00:09:55.519 they're protected by these bones of the
00:09:57.640 rib cage can you feel your rib cage just
00:09:59.360 feel down your side just tap it a little
00:10:00.920 bit and you can feel those hard bones
00:10:02.720 that protect your heart and your other
00:10:05.160 organs and there's one other part up
00:10:07.560 here at the top why do you think we have
00:10:10.160 a hard bone at the top of our head cuz
00:10:12.720 you have have a brain we all have brains
00:10:14.760 right and brains are very soft too and
00:10:16.880 we don't want to hurt them so they're
00:10:18.519 protected inside the skull and if you
00:10:21.040 just tap your head just very lightly you
00:10:22.440 can feel that hard bone that's in there
00:10:25.040 so our bones also give us
00:10:28.040 protection I'll I'll get
00:10:30.300 [Music]
00:10:33.640 it hi Janice hi Janice hi guys boy am I
00:10:39.200 having a bad day hi Janice hi Bob Janice

00:10:58.200 and I broke my arm arm did it hurt a
00:11:00.880 little at first but now it's okay well
00:11:03.480 that's why we have to think about safety
00:11:05.320 cuz even though our bones protect us we
00:11:07.560 have to protect our bones as
00:11:10.720 [Music]
00:11:13.639 well oh when you think about your bones
00:11:16.760 where do you begin cuz your bones do
00:11:19.639 more than give you a place to hang your
00:11:21.760 skin they help to keep your insights
00:11:25.040 safe and sound they help you walk sit

00:16:00.839 look like you it's a bunch ofat stuff
00:16:03.759 it's fun to know watch listen and
00:16:06.590 [Music]
00:16:27.519 learn
00:16:30.199 well that looks like fun doesn't it
00:16:31.959 would any of you like to walk in space
00:16:35.160 abolutely you don't really walk you just
00:16:37.959 float boy I'd sure like to be up there
00:16:40.639 floating around and having fun in space
00:16:42.720 but I have a question why do astronauts
00:16:45.800 have to wear those space suits all the
00:16:47.399 time does anybody know I do because
00:16:49.839 there isn't any air in ourter space but
00:16:52.839 why is air so important because they
00:16:55.639 have air in their space suits so they
00:16:58.680 can breathe oh so they can breathe hm
00:17:02.040 well that's very interesting you know I
00:17:03.600 know of another place where there isn't
00:17:05.319 any air and when people go there they
00:17:07.599 have to wear special equipment they have
00:17:09.240 to wear a special mask so that they can
00:17:11.280 breathe any idea where it might be no
00:17:14.520 let's watch and find
00:17:16.679 out when you go swimming you know that
00:17:19.280 you can't stay underwater for very long
00:17:21.640 you have to hold your breath because
00:17:23.640 there's no air to breathe underwater and
00:17:25.839 people need air to breathe and to live
00:17:29.160 so if you want to spend a long time
00:17:30.760 underwater you have to do what these
00:17:32.400 divers do you have to bring some air
00:17:34.480 with you they have air in those tanks on
00:17:37.080 their
00:17:39.320 backs so when people go underwater or
00:17:42.960 when they go into space or even if
00:17:44.360 you're just running around the house you
00:17:46.120 need air to breathe and air is kind of
00:17:48.960 mysterious stuff isn't it I mean you
00:17:50.799 can't see it you you can't feel it
00:17:53.480 although if you do this just run your
00:17:55.120 your hand up and down really fast can
00:17:56.480 you sort of feel it going through your
00:17:57.640 fingers you can feel it a little bit air
00:18:00.120 is actually real stuff we can sort of
00:18:02.960 see what air is like this bag doesn't
00:18:05.240 have anything in it right now right okay
00:18:07.520 so let's fill it up
00:18:10.320 with air and we'll get the bag really
00:18:13.559 full of air and look now it feels like
00:18:18.000 there's something in there can you feel
00:18:19.120 that yeah it feels really bushy but you
00:18:22.039 can push on it there's something in it
00:18:24.159 air is real stuff I mean airplanes fly
00:18:27.360 in it and birds fly in it and yet inside
00:18:30.360 the bag it looks like there's nothing at
00:18:32.640 all just air and we need air to breathe
00:18:36.080 and you're breathing right now and so
00:18:38.000 are you now when you do breathe where
00:18:41.240 does the air go into your body your nose
00:18:44.600 to your nose to my mouth your nose your
00:18:48.039 mouth H we seem to have a little
00:18:50.240 argument here your nose your mouth I
00:18:52.000 wonder which it is let's do a little
00:18:53.520 experiment put your hands over your
00:18:55.520 mouth like this really tight okay now
00:18:58.159 just just breathe while you're doing
00:19:01.000 that where's the air going through my
00:19:03.480 nose through your nose and if you do it
00:19:06.360 really fast you can actually hear it
00:19:07.720 going in and
00:19:09.480 out okay now try this take your finger
00:19:12.600 and put it over your nose like this
00:19:14.760 pinch so that okay so you now Breathe
00:19:19.280 Again where's the air going this time
00:19:21.880 through my mouth do your mouth so you're
00:19:24.919 both right yeah you're both right the
00:19:27.120 air goes into your nose no or into your
00:19:29.480 mouth or both and actually it's a good
00:19:31.400 thing that it can because sometimes when
00:19:33.159 you have a cold your nose gets all
00:19:34.919 stuffed up and you can't breathe through
00:19:36.919 your nose so it's a good thing that you
00:19:38.600 can still breathe through your mouth
00:19:40.679 well if you need to breathe the air in
00:19:43.360 through your nose and your mouth where
00:19:45.400 does it go then where does it go inside
00:19:47.840 your body want to find out everybody up
00:19:50.799 let's try this and you can try this as
00:19:52.640 well put your hands on your on your side
00:19:55.760 so of put them put them like this okay
00:19:58.240 just feel your chest now take in a
00:20:00.559 really deep breath you ready one two
00:20:02.600 three
00:20:03.559 in hold it you feel how your chest gets
00:20:06.880 bigger when you do that okay now let it
00:20:10.200 out and when you let it out your chest
00:20:12.640 gets smaller okay breathe in one more
00:20:14.159 time when you breathe in like this all
00:20:17.159 the way in the air goes in through your
00:20:18.760 nose and mouth and into two large bags
00:20:21.520 that are inside your chest called your
00:20:22.960 lungs would you like to see how your
00:20:24.360 lungs work come on I'll show you how
00:20:26.240 your lungs actually do that
00:20:28.799 can we breathe out oh yes yes yes you
00:20:30.679 can breathe out you can breathe out now
00:20:32.200 okay don't hold it in like that now
00:20:34.360 let's see how your lungs really work
00:20:35.919 inside your chest come
00:20:39.559 on now if you could see inside your
00:20:43.280 chest that's what your lungs look like
00:20:45.400 these two pink bags right here and when
00:20:47.960 you breathe these bags fill up with air
00:20:50.520 and the red thing that's in the middle
00:20:51.799 that's your heart so your lungs kind of
00:20:53.440 wrap around your heart like that now the
00:20:55.200 way they work is something like well
00:20:56.840 it's sort of like this the can you blow
00:20:58.600 that balloon
00:21:01.880 up when you breathe in your lungs get
00:21:04.440 bigger like the balloon cuz they fill
00:21:05.799 with air and then let it go when you
00:21:07.919 breathe out the air goes out and your
00:21:10.279 lungs get smaller so your lungs are just
00:21:12.520 like two balloons that are in your chest
00:21:14.440 like this and you have a tube that comes
00:21:17.120 up your throat and it ends up at your
00:21:19.320 nose and your mouth and that's where you
00:21:20.679 breathe in and out now let's have a
00:21:22.080 closer look since this is a model I can
00:21:23.919 take it apart so let's take this long
00:21:26.240 apart there we are and I'll take the
00:21:28.400 heart out so that we can see this a
00:21:29.480 little better there we have our two
00:21:31.880 lungs and here's the tube that comes
00:21:34.840 down your throat and then see how it
00:21:36.600 splits here one goes to one lung one
00:21:39.000 goes to the other lung and then it keeps
00:21:40.760 splitting it splits again here and then
00:21:42.880 it splits again there and it keeps going
00:21:44.760 down and these tubes carry the air to
00:21:47.679 every part of your lungs and then see
00:21:50.600 these little tiny spots there you can
00:21:52.559 just barely see them the tubes lead to
00:21:54.880 what are called air socks and they do
00:21:57.279 just what their name means they take in
00:21:59.279 and they fill up with air let's have a
00:22:01.200 closer look at the air
00:22:03.320 sacks as it fills up with air an air
00:22:06.240 sack does a wonderful thing it takes
00:22:08.600 something out of the air a special gas
00:22:11.240 and it puts that special gas into your
00:22:13.520 blood what is this special gas well
00:22:16.480 first we have to understand that air is
00:22:18.400 actually made up of lots of different
00:22:19.840 things it's just a swirl of all these
00:22:22.320 different invisible gases but your body
00:22:24.919 only needs one of them and that one's
00:22:26.919 called oxygen now let me spell that for
00:22:29.240 you I can spell it you can spell oxygen
00:22:31.840 that's a that's a pretty hard word give
00:22:34.200 me a break o x y g e n oxygen whoa let's
00:22:41.600 hear it from
00:22:43.559 Jody oxygen that's what your body needs
00:22:46.720 but it's only one part of the air so
00:22:49.120 your lungs do a very important job they
00:22:51.520 take just the oxygen out of the air so
00:22:53.720 that your body can use
00:22:55.320 it when you breathe in your air sacks
00:22:58.440 take just the oxygen out of the air and
00:23:00.760 put it into your blood your blood takes
00:23:03.000 the oxygen to every part of your body
00:23:05.400 but something else happens after your
00:23:07.960 body uses the oxygen well you have
00:23:10.520 inside of you a lot of gases that you
00:23:12.440 didn't use we call that used air how do
00:23:15.760 we get rid of used air you breathe out
00:23:19.320 so come on let's get rid of some used
00:23:21.200 air when you breathe out your body is
00:23:24.159 getting rid of gases that it just
00:23:25.840 doesn't use so it's oxygen
00:23:29.559 in used air
00:23:33.630 [Music]
00:23:35.440 out be glad that you breathe out your
00:23:38.720 air it's the T on the fute and the
00:23:42.400 trumpet be glad you can blow through
00:23:45.039 your mouth when balloons need to be
00:23:48.200 blown up and be glad you can whistle and
00:23:52.440 sing every sneeze is a reason for
00:23:56.039 rejoicing be glad that you breathe out
00:23:59.080 your with every PP you have the St to
00:24:01.960 make
00:24:03.590 [Music]
00:24:06.080 excitement be glad that you breathe out
00:24:08.919 your air be glad when you're Haring and
00:24:13.120 poing be glad that there's air
00:24:16.240 everywhere cuz it let you gigle and
00:24:19.799 laugh be glad that you know that there's
00:24:23.039 air you don't see it but you know it's
00:24:25.840 always with you glad that there's air
00:24:29.960 everywhere every P you have the St you
00:24:32.600 make
00:24:35.679 excit so we know what your lungs like
00:24:38.520 pure clean oxygen but are the things
00:24:41.320 that your lungs don't like and how do
00:24:43.520 you know if your lungs don't feel right
00:24:45.799 well you
00:24:48.840 cough excuse me have you ever done that
00:24:52.080 when you cough your lungs might be
00:24:54.159 telling you hey there's something in the
00:24:56.320 air we just don't like now let me show
00:24:59.799 you some things and you tell me which of
00:25:02.760 these things would make you
00:25:05.279 cough would this make you cough probably
00:25:09.919 not what if you breathed in that
00:25:13.760 smoke how about
00:25:16.200 this would your lungs like
00:25:21.360 this do you think you'd be coughing
00:25:24.880 here what about cigarette smoke does
00:25:27.520 that that ever make you
00:25:29.880 cough smoke makes you cough doesn't it
00:25:32.600 and it doesn't matter if it's smoke from
00:25:34.200 burning leaves a cigarette or even a
00:25:36.840 smoke stack your lungs just don't like
00:25:39.080 it and you can probably guess why your
00:25:41.480 lungs Like Oxygen right well the smoke
00:25:44.279 prevents that oxygen from getting in so
00:25:46.360 one of the ways to keep your lungs
00:25:47.799 healthy is to just stay away from smoke
00:25:50.679 but what if you can't stay away from
00:25:52.720 smoke what if your job takes you near
00:25:55.279 fire you know who I'm talking about
00:25:58.320 hi Mr Bones nice
00:26:00.320 hat firefighters are around smoke all
00:26:03.080 the time so how do you think they
00:26:05.279 prevent that smoke from getting into
00:26:06.679 their lungs well ch's neighbor is a
00:26:09.080 firefighter and recently he went to
00:26:10.919 visit
00:26:12.279 her so how are you doing today CH fine
00:26:15.840 that's good you've come to the Firehouse
00:26:17.720 today to find out how firefighters keep
00:26:19.240 their lungs safe in a building fire
00:26:20.919 uh-huh that's a very good question we
00:26:23.200 have a special piece of equipment called
00:26:24.760 a self-contained breathing
00:26:26.600 apparatus
00:26:30.360 we call them the SCBA for sure it looks
00:26:32.840 like a scuba diver's tank that's exactly
00:26:36.000 what it is but this one you don't use
00:26:37.760 underneath the water this is for when
00:26:39.360 you're on the ground we use this to go
00:26:41.520 into building fires because there's so
00:26:43.399 many poisonous gases from the things
00:26:45.440 that are burning in the fire there we
00:26:46.840 can't breathe that air there's no oxygen
00:26:49.000 in it so we take our own air in this
00:26:50.559 bottle there's about 30 minutes of air
00:26:52.799 in here it air comes out of the tube and
00:26:55.600 it goes into the mask okay wej try it on
00:26:58.760 sure okay be careful it's kind of
00:27:05.000 heavy wao this is heavy okay let me help
00:27:08.399 you hold it okay first thing you have to
00:27:10.919 do is make sure that it's on okay then
00:27:14.399 you put the mask over your face and you
00:27:16.039 breathe it
00:27:17.440 in there's a plastic shield on there so
00:27:19.919 you can see what you're
00:27:21.399 doing you feel the air
00:27:24.919 uh-huh see this is clean air it's not
00:27:27.279 the air that you're going to breathe in
00:27:28.520 a house that is
00:27:31.240 burning this feels
00:27:35.720 funny let's turn it
00:27:37.510 [Music]
00:27:44.780 [Applause]
00:27:56.519 off
00:28:15.360 people need
00:28:16.919 air you breathe through your nose and
00:28:19.600 your
00:28:20.480 mouth the air goes down an air pipe and
00:28:23.440 into your lungs when you breathe in your
00:28:26.039 lungs get bigger
00:28:28.200 inside of your lungs are tiny sacks
00:28:30.760 called air sacks they take the oxygen
00:28:33.960 out of the air and put it into your
00:28:36.640 blood when you breathe out you're
00:28:38.919 getting rid of used air you breathe out
00:28:42.320 when you talk and whistle your lungs
00:28:44.840 don't like smoke stay away from smoke if
00:28:48.600 you want your lungs to stay
00:28:51.130 [Music]
00:28:53.640 healthy and nice fresh fruit here's one
00:28:57.080 more thing to think about when it comes
00:28:58.760 to your lungs I'm sure your parents have
00:29:00.720 told you that this is not a toy since
00:29:03.799 we've been thinking about our lungs
00:29:05.039 today I'm sure you can see why this is a
00:29:06.919 dangerous thing to play with oxygen does
00:29:09.360 not go through plastic so if you put
00:29:11.679 this bag over your head the oxygen
00:29:13.960 cannot get into your lungs that's why
00:29:16.120 it's dangerous it's also dangerous to
00:29:18.159 put yourself into a small closed trunk
00:29:20.679 or a closed refrigerator there just may
00:29:22.880 not be enough oxygen in there for you to
00:29:25.000 Breathe by the way there's something
00:29:27.840 else we can do with the air that's in
00:29:29.200 our lungs we can use it to sing it's
00:29:31.919 Jody's birthday today happy birthday to
00:29:56.320 you

00:31:42.880 amazing that's not magic well then where
00:31:46.039 did it go do you
00:31:49.159 know do you know where it went what
00:31:52.880 happens to food after you swallow it
00:31:55.200 does it just disappear like magic oh I
00:31:58.960 know where it goes food goes down to
00:32:01.440 your stomach well you're right Arnell
00:32:03.559 food does go to your stomach but how
00:32:05.760 does it get there and what happens to it
00:32:07.919 after it's in your stomach I don't know
00:32:10.679 well why don't we find out let's think

00:32:30.760 digest food uh H there seems to be
00:32:34.720 something missing over here we don't
00:32:36.519 have a head and we need a head because
00:32:38.880 that's where the trip that the food
00:32:40.200 takes begins who wants to be the head I
00:32:42.919 will okay Diego come on back you can be
00:32:45.000 the head good now we have a nice head
00:32:47.600 get right in there so uh Diego uh how
00:32:51.279 you doing today say you're hungry I'm
00:32:53.880 hungry hungry huh hm what's it feel like
00:32:56.440 to be hungry
00:32:57.919 um my stomach is growling and I don't
00:33:01.440 have any energy and all I can think of
00:33:04.720 is getting some food excellent isn't it
00:33:08.000 amazing how your body tells you that it
00:33:09.679 needs food you can actually feel it uh
00:33:12.679 so Diego would you like a muffin yes
00:33:15.360 please coming right up here we
00:33:18.720 are this is the beginning of a very long
00:33:21.960 trip for this muffin now where does it
00:33:24.840 go in his mouth the mouth open
00:33:30.279 wide well we're already seeing the first
00:33:32.679 thing that happens to the food you chew
00:33:34.679 it up now when you chew your teeth act
00:33:37.559 like knives and they actually cut the
00:33:40.320 food into little tiny pieces but there's
00:33:43.519 something else that happens inside your
00:33:45.120 mouth your mouth is wet and that liquid
00:33:48.480 that's in your mouth helps make the food
00:33:51.159 soft so we'll just add a little bit of
00:33:53.360 liquid here soow your teeth cut it into
00:33:56.360 little pieces and the liquid in your
00:33:58.279 mouth makes it soft until it looks well
00:34:01.279 something like that and once it looks
00:34:03.600 like this you're ready to swallow have
00:34:05.679 you swallowed your muffin Diego yes okay
00:34:08.560 when you swallow it goes down your
00:34:10.480 throat so right
00:34:12.800 now these little pieces of food go down
00:34:15.839 a tube that's inside your throat and
00:34:18.040 when you swallow they go down and down
00:34:20.239 and down until they end up inside AR now
00:34:23.560 what in your stomach right and there's
00:34:26.040 your stomach right there and that's
00:34:27.760 where the food goes but the trip isn't
00:34:29.719 over yet because something else happens
00:34:31.639 inside your
00:34:32.639 stomach your stomach also has liquid in
00:34:35.440 it so we add a little bit more to our
00:34:38.119 muffin and your stomach can move and it
00:34:40.960 does something like your teeth it sort
00:34:42.599 of grinds the food up into even smaller
00:34:47.159 pieces like
00:34:51.918 this so that eventually the muffin
00:34:54.639 doesn't look like a muffin anymore it
00:34:57.079 looks something
00:34:59.599 like e what is that goop that goop that
00:35:04.280 goop is what's inside your stomach right
00:35:06.839 now the liquid has made it soft it's
00:35:08.920 been chewed into very very tiny pieces
00:35:11.240 but the trip isn't over yet there's
00:35:12.880 still one more place that it
00:35:14.839 goes and that's into your intestines
00:35:19.920 yuck if you could look at your intestine
00:35:22.320 in a microscope you'd see that it
00:35:24.119 actually has millions of tiny little
00:35:25.720 holes in it so when the food goes
00:35:27.880 through the tube some of the food slips
00:35:30.079 out through those holes so that means
00:35:32.400 that some of the food that you've eaten
00:35:34.280 comes out here and some of it comes out
00:35:36.440 over here some over here slipping out
00:35:39.000 through those millions of tiny little
00:35:40.520 holes now here's the amazing part once
00:35:43.160 the food goes out through those holes in
00:35:45.119 the intestine where do you think it goes
00:35:47.520 into your blood your blood uh-huh the
00:35:51.040 food that you've eaten goes into your
00:35:52.680 blood so Arnell and Sam would you like
00:35:55.560 to take these red pens here and show us
00:35:58.960 just where blood goes in your body just
00:36:01.480 draw it right on Diego's body
00:36:03.839 there your blood goes to your
00:36:07.440 heart then some to your arms and hands
00:36:12.079 and
00:36:18.359 fingers some blood goes down your legs
00:36:23.920 and to your
00:36:25.720 feet don't forget my brain okay here's
00:36:29.560 the blood going to your
00:36:31.880 brain your blood goes almost everywhere
00:36:34.160 in your body and in your blood are those
00:36:36.280 tiny pieces of food and that's how your
00:36:38.200 body gets its food when you eat your
00:36:40.359 teeth mash the food into little pieces
00:36:42.440 your stomach turns it into a liquid so
00:36:44.319 it can go into your intestine into your
00:36:46.319 blood and flow throughout your entire
00:36:48.319 body and that happens every time you
00:36:51.000 eat oranges
00:36:53.160 H what if all you ever wanted to eat
00:36:56.440 were oranges you had oranges for
00:36:58.440 breakfast oranges for lunch for a snack
00:37:00.520 you have oranges oranges for dinner
00:37:03.000 you'd get tired of oranges pretty fast
00:37:04.880 wouldn't you and at the same time your
00:37:07.160 body would not be getting everything it
00:37:08.680 needs to stay healthy I mean oranges are
00:37:11.079 good for you but your body needs
00:37:13.000 different kinds of food so that it can
00:37:15.359 grow so that you can have energy energy
00:37:17.680 to ride your bicycle run upstairs and
00:37:19.839 move all the parts of your body but how
00:37:22.280 do you know which are the right kinds of
00:37:24.640 food to eat well the kids can help us

00:38:31.839 you see all this food I have over here
00:38:33.800 yeah yeah okay I wonder which types of
00:38:37.480 food go into the different groups do you
00:38:40.480 think that you could sort all this food
00:38:42.200 and put them into the different baskets

00:38:46.240 problem all right yeah well there's a
00:38:48.520 catch to this there's a catch to this do

00:45:50.860 [Music]
00:45:53.319 bathroom yes hi everybody what's so
00:45:56.800 funny uh Bob the show started the show
00:46:02.200 oh hi uh sorry I wasn't here earlier I
00:46:05.640 uh well actually I was here earlier but
00:46:07.559 then I had to uh I had to go U you had
00:46:09.880 to go to the bathroom well thanks for
00:46:12.319 telling everybody Sarah you're
00:46:14.680 welcome oh well that happens doesn't it
00:46:18.440 couple of times every day you have to
00:46:19.960 stop whatever you're doing and go to the
00:46:21.880 bathroom well it's nothing to be
00:46:23.400 embarrassed about really everybody does
00:46:25.040 it and when you go to the bathroom your
00:46:26.920 body's actually doing something very
00:46:28.640 important well I guess uh today's a good
00:46:31.160 day to think about why we have to go to
00:46:33.079 the bathroom and I know a good place to
00:46:35.280 start some of you may have seen an
00:46:37.359 earlier program where we talked about
00:46:39.200 what happens when you eat something I
00:46:41.200 saw that show oh it's great child maybe
00:46:43.559 you saw Diego eating a muffin how' you
00:46:47.200 like to tell us and remind us what
00:46:48.720 happens after you do eat something sure
00:46:51.119 that's
00:46:52.440 easy the first thing you do is chew
00:46:56.599 your teeth break food into little pieces
00:47:00.040 and the liquid in your mouth makes it
00:47:02.880 soft then you
00:47:05.000 swallow the food goes down your long
00:47:07.680 tube to your stomach your stomach mashes
00:47:10.800 it and adds liquid and soon your food is
00:47:14.800 turned into a soupy liquid it looks like
00:47:18.599 this then it goes into another long tube
00:47:22.319 that's your intestine it has a lot of
00:47:25.079 tiny holes
00:47:26.240 and little bits of food go through the
00:47:28.319 holes and into your
00:47:31.319 blood thanks child that was great well
00:47:34.119 our program told us what happens to food
00:47:36.079 that's inside your body but it left out
00:47:38.640 one very important thing what come on
00:47:41.839 I'll show
00:47:45.520 you let's do an experiment to show what
00:47:48.800 happens to food when it's in your
00:47:50.280 intestine here's a bowl and over the top
00:47:53.400 of the bowl there is a piece of cloth
00:47:55.280 and can you see how the cloth has some
00:47:57.319 holes in it now those holes are like the
00:47:59.880 holes in your intestine now these holes
00:48:01.480 are a lot bigger than the real holes but
00:48:03.400 that's just so that we can see it now
00:48:05.520 when the food goes into your intestine
00:48:07.160 it goes through the holes and it goes
00:48:09.520 into your blood well let's get some food
00:48:11.480 here before it gets to the intestine
00:48:13.240 it's in your stomach so here's what used
00:48:15.079 to be a muffin inside our stomach here
00:48:18.040 and let's suppose you're really hungry
00:48:19.559 you want to have another one so Naomi
00:48:21.160 you want to take this muffin and just
00:48:22.680 grind it up there inside the stomach now
00:48:25.040 your stomach add fluids to that food to
00:48:26.960 help break it down hello bird hi Bob so
00:48:30.280 we'll just add a little bit of fluid
00:48:32.079 here and then your stomach churns that
00:48:34.880 food around so that it'll break it down
00:48:37.200 even further so you want to churn up the
00:48:39.160 stomach there ah there it goes and turns
00:48:41.280 our muffin into a nice sloppy goop okay
00:48:45.480 now it goes into the intestine so let's
00:48:47.880 see what happens when it gets to the
00:48:49.319 intestine W now we just pour it right on
00:48:51.200 through the cloth there and let's see
00:48:52.319 what happens
00:48:54.599 m ew so what happened all of it didn't
00:48:58.960 go through that's right look carefully
00:49:00.920 you can see that in the bottom of the
00:49:03.000 bowl some of it did go through and that
00:49:06.079 liquid that does go through goes into
00:49:07.640 your blood and then that goes through
00:49:08.960 your whole body and that's how your body
00:49:10.359 gets food but your body doesn't use all
00:49:14.000 of the food that you eat now we have a
00:49:15.599 name for that that's called waste and
00:49:18.040 because your body doesn't use the waste
00:49:19.799 it has to get rid of it somehow that's
00:49:22.480 why we go to the bathroom that's right
00:49:24.520 Sarah that's why go to the bathroom
00:49:26.760 since your body doesn't use all of the
00:49:28.559 food that we eat it has to get rid of
00:49:30.359 the waste and to show you just how it
00:49:32.240 does that let's go to a model just over
00:49:38.200 here this is a model of what the inside
00:49:41.000 of your body looks like say hi to Kathy
00:49:43.319 hi Kathy now this part down here that's
00:49:46.720 where the food goes after you eat it
00:49:48.359 it's the soft part of your tummy can you
00:49:50.200 feel this part right here feel how it's
00:49:51.520 kind of soft down there yeah that's this
00:49:53.240 part here so after you eat the food it
00:49:55.160 goes in your your mouth down the throat
00:49:56.880 and into this kind of baggy looking
00:49:59.200 thing what do you think that is a
00:50:00.839 stomach that's right that's your stomach
00:50:02.440 and that's where the food is turned into
00:50:03.839 that goop that we had before and then it
00:50:05.960 goes into this long tube down here we
00:50:09.359 call that the small intestine and that's
00:50:11.480 the tube that's as long as this room and
00:50:13.200 it's all been stuffed up in there so
00:50:14.760 some of the food goes through the little
00:50:16.359 tiny holes into the blood and then the
00:50:18.440 stuff that doesn't do that that your
00:50:19.880 body doesn't use goes all the way
00:50:22.640 through the tube and that waist goes
00:50:24.599 into this part here what do you think
00:50:26.079 that's called the large intestine yeah
00:50:28.799 that's right it's the large intestine
00:50:30.400 because it's larger than the small
00:50:31.760 intestine and then that waist goes all
00:50:34.160 the way around here and the large
00:50:35.920 intestine holds on to it until we need
00:50:37.799 to get rid of it that's when we go to
00:50:39.880 the bathroom and that's when we go to
00:50:41.960 the bathroom that's right I'll get
00:50:47.760 it it's
00:50:49.160 [Applause]

00:50:58.920 bathroom excuse me um no we're uh we're
00:51:02.920 thinking about how your body gets rid of
00:51:04.960 food that it doesn't use amazing I can't
00:51:08.119 believe this but I once wrote a song
00:51:09.760 about that very subject you did most
00:51:11.760 people write about love or the moon I
00:51:14.280 wrote a song about waste wow well uh can

00:51:32.280 happen let
00:51:34.040 see it's been a while let me see if I
00:51:36.119 can remember this
00:51:39.440 okay when you have a meal you sometimes
00:51:43.319 feel you can eat every bit of the
00:51:46.880 food but when the heating starts you
00:51:50.280 always find parts that AR supposed to be
00:51:54.480 ch
00:51:56.359 there's always something left
00:51:59.640 over the part that you don't
00:52:03.319 need like the stam in the pit and the
00:52:06.480 Caron the GP and the bone in the middle
00:52:10.160 of the
00:52:11.079 knat yes there's always something left
00:52:15.160 over it sits there in a
00:52:18.720 Clum so you put it in a canon in a
00:52:22.240 garbage
00:52:23.520 man takes it to to the
00:52:26.520 D yes you put it in a can and then the
00:52:29.920 garbage
00:52:31.280 man takes it to the
00:52:34.599 D now after you eat and you're feeling
00:52:38.200 real neat your intestines have work to
00:52:42.200 do but soon you feel hey part of that
00:52:46.319 meal is moving all the way
00:52:50.400 through CU there's always something left
00:52:54.240 over the part you don't
00:52:58.480 digest the body is you only part of the
00:53:02.799 food and leave behind the
00:53:06.000 rest yes there's always something left

00:54:07.240 [Music]
00:54:08.599 s well so far we've only been talking
00:54:10.960 about one kind of waste that your body
00:54:13.359 produces that's the solid waste but you
00:54:15.680 know that when you go to the bathroom
00:54:17.200 you also produce a yellow liquid you
00:54:19.480 know what I mean sometimes you just
00:54:21.079 produce the yellow liquid sometimes just
00:54:22.960 a solid sometimes it's both do you know
00:54:25.200 the name of that liquid well it's called
00:54:27.520 urine and urine is produced by a
00:54:30.480 different part of your body but it's
00:54:31.960 also a waste product let's go back to
00:54:35.160 Cathy over here now here's the small and
00:54:38.240 large intestine they produce the solid
00:54:40.280 waste but if we take them
00:54:41.960 out you can see just behind them there
00:54:44.400 are two other little organs these purple
00:54:47.119 things here those are called your
00:54:49.200 kidneys and if you want to find out
00:54:50.599 where your kidneys are in your body just
00:54:52.640 put your hands on your waist like this
00:54:54.520 until your fing fingers are almost
00:54:55.760 touching behind your back one kidney is
00:54:58.119 underneath your hand here and the other
00:55:00.079 kidney is under your other hand back
00:55:01.599 here now after food goes through your
00:55:04.440 blood the blood needs to be cleaned and
00:55:07.000 get the urine out well that's what the
00:55:08.760 kidneys do they clean the blood they
00:55:10.799 produce the urine which is the leftover
00:55:12.760 waste that your body doesn't use and
00:55:14.960 then it goes down these tubes here and
00:55:18.480 here and into another part that's called
00:55:20.319 the bladder and the bladder is really
00:55:22.520 nothing more than just a little bag it's
00:55:24.079 sort of like this balloon that's filled
00:55:26.240 with liquid and when that bladder fills
00:55:28.920 up that's when you need to go to the
00:55:30.480 bathroom and when you do need to go to
00:55:31.920 the bathroom the bag empties and you
00:55:33.880 produce the urine it's kind of neat how
00:55:35.760 your body tells you how you need to go
00:55:38.119 to the bathroom you suddenly you just
00:55:39.799 don't feel very comfortable well if you
00:55:41.760 do get that feeling of discomfort go
