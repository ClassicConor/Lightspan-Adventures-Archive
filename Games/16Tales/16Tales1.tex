            The Fire Bringer \& How Saynday Borought the Buffalo to the Indians
                                 &
            The story revolves around two Native American legends: "The Firebringer" from the Paiute tribe and "How the Buffalo Came to the Indians" from the Kiowa tribe.
            In "The Firebringer," an Indian boy seeks to help his people who are suffering in the cold winter without fire.
            With the guidance of Coyote, they embark on a dangerous journey to obtain fire from a burning mountain.
            Despite initial skepticism, they succeed in bringing fire back to their tribe, earning the boy the name "Firebringer."
            In "How the Buffalo Came to the Indians," Sand Day, observing the suffering of animals due to hunger, devises a plan to discover the source of White Crow's abundant food.
            Through trickery, Sand Day uncovers a hidden stash of buffalo meat, leading to the release of the buffalo to roam freely and provide sustenance for the Native American tribes.
            Both stories highlight the importance of survival, resourcefulness, and the interconnectedness between humans and nature in Native American folklore.
