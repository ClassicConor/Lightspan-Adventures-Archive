00:00:51.199 teaching can be a lonely profession
00:00:54.000 isolated in their own classrooms
00:00:56.320 teachers may have few chances for new
00:00:58.719 learning for growth
00:01:00.160 for working with colleagues
00:01:02.630 
00:01:04.400 i think the only way that educators can
00:01:07.119 truly make a difference in the lives of
00:01:08.479 all their children
00:01:09.520 is if within the building they have a
00:01:11.040 sense of support from one another
00:01:13.200 if you're out there on your own you
00:01:14.960 might do really great for a while but
00:01:16.560 you're eventually going to burn out
00:01:18.080 because you can't do it on your own
00:01:37.570 
00:01:43.040 how about the appropriateness of the
00:01:44.720 task was it appropriate
00:01:46.320 for both sets at the highly effective
00:01:48.640 schools we visited
00:01:50.000 teachers and administrators learn from
00:01:52.079 each other through
00:01:53.040 staff development it's a process that
00:01:55.600 can take many forms
00:02:01.680 a principle demonstrating an effective
00:02:03.759 lesson for a new teacher
00:02:17.520 this program won't give you a formula
00:02:19.440 for doing staff development in your
00:02:21.120 school
00:02:21.760 each school is unique but we are going
00:02:24.080 to show you the characteristics of staff
00:02:26.400 development
00:02:27.280 at some highly successful schools
00:02:36.120 
00:02:40.800 welcome to bennett q elementary
00:02:42.959 inglewood california
00:02:46.400 you won't hear just educational theory
00:02:48.640 from principal nancy ishinagua
00:02:50.959 her school practices staff development
00:02:53.120 that is focused
00:02:54.239 specific and practical
00:02:59.519 at this lunchtime and some of her
00:03:02.959 first-year teachers
00:03:04.319 talk about improving student writing
00:03:06.879 well what do i need to work on
00:03:08.239 i did find one weakness with your kids
00:03:10.080 they write just like they talk
00:03:12.640 they go on and on and on
00:03:15.680 so that's interesting the real problem
00:03:17.519 with your kids is not the lack of words
00:03:20.000 or the use
00:03:20.640 usage of words the fact that they have
00:03:23.120 run on sentences i think
00:03:24.959 maybe nine kids yeah they do the only
00:03:27.599 time they catch it is when i go up to
00:03:29.120 them and make them read it to me
00:03:30.319 and say stop every time that an idea
00:03:32.720 finishes and then they
00:03:33.840 figure out and i think you should be
00:03:35.599 here i think that that you can work on
00:03:37.680 real simply because these kids will be
00:03:39.040 good writers because they can express
00:03:40.319 themselves it's just the mechanics they
00:03:41.680 need to know
00:03:42.400 now as follows laura's kids their
00:03:44.799 sentences were a lot shorter
00:03:46.879 so they didn't make as many mistakes in
00:03:48.959 other words
00:03:49.920 her kids were better able to control the
00:03:51.920 sentences by making them simple
00:03:53.680 right and i think that that's one of the
00:03:55.599 objectives we do we want to make sure
00:03:57.120 that we
00:03:58.080 the sentences are under control okay so
00:04:00.560 that's my analysis
00:04:02.319 now you got any response to what i did
00:04:04.799 well i think with the
00:04:05.680 with the just watching when i went down
00:04:07.920 to ellen's room
00:04:09.200 with the kids that don't have an idea of
00:04:10.640 a paragraph or an idea of um
00:04:13.439 sentences and the order and they ramble
00:04:15.360 is that you really structure it before
00:04:17.600 them
00:04:18.000 for them hi very highly structured
00:04:20.320 before they actually go back to their
00:04:21.759 seats and that way they get the
00:04:23.199 idea in their head and then after you've
00:04:24.800 done that a number of times
00:04:26.880 then let them let them go and watching
00:04:28.639 ellen really yeah i think
00:04:30.080 made that clear informal staff
00:04:32.240 development meetings like this one at
00:04:34.080 bennett q
00:04:35.040 are one way for teachers to exchange
00:04:37.280 practical advice
00:04:38.560 and solve problems you know i give the
00:04:41.280 teachers a chance to figure out
00:04:43.120 problems they they come to me with
00:04:45.520 problems and
00:04:46.320 generally with solutions i can't do it
00:04:48.320 all by myself i don't have all the
00:04:49.840 answers
00:04:51.840 so i use my staff to train the others as
00:04:55.360 well
00:04:56.160 i just kind of create the situation in
00:04:59.199 which
00:04:59.600 this can happen no school tomorrow mom
00:05:03.759 the teachers are regrouping
00:05:11.440 give you the book now and i want you to
00:05:12.880 open up to the page and you're going to
00:05:14.639 read along with your eyes as mrs
00:05:16.080 craftwood reads it to you
00:05:17.759 here's another form of staff development
00:05:20.000 as melanie crawford teaches a lesson to
00:05:22.160 her class
00:05:23.120 three new teachers watch the purpose for
00:05:26.240 the new teachers to sharpen their
00:05:27.919 observation skills
00:05:29.360 and begin to model good teaching how
00:05:32.400 about the appropriateness of the task
00:05:34.400 was it appropriate for both sets of kids
00:05:38.080 after the lesson melanie crawford meets
00:05:40.320 with the new teachers to find out what
00:05:42.320 they observed in her class
00:05:44.639 so i thought that the the activities
00:05:46.880 were
00:05:48.320 i thought they were appropriate because
00:05:49.680 the kids could take it and do it with
00:05:51.520 what they
00:05:52.000 could what were other indicators that
00:05:55.280 it was appropriate for both levels i've
00:05:57.600 seen children look very frustrated when
00:05:59.360 they're frustrated they'll just sit
00:06:00.479 there
00:06:00.960 and they won't do anything everybody was
00:06:03.199 kind of focused in to what they were
00:06:04.800 doing
00:06:05.680 so what we're really looking at is time
00:06:07.440 on task
00:06:08.960 and that children were engaged to
00:06:13.039 a level where they are successful
00:06:16.000 independently principal esther mcshane
00:06:18.479 attends as many of these sessions as she
00:06:20.479 can
00:06:21.840 she also makes it a priority to spend
00:06:24.000 time with individual teachers
00:06:26.160 observing them giving them feedback on
00:06:28.400 what she's seen
00:06:29.840 whatever let's say this is the picture
00:06:32.080 and that you would show the picture to
00:06:33.600 the entire
00:06:34.880 group and say study this picture and be
00:06:37.919 ready to tell me
00:06:39.600 what animal this is and how do you know
00:06:42.560 it's that animal
00:06:43.680 because they do have the background okay
00:06:46.240 it became a very low level
00:06:48.080 of questioning but if you get them to
00:06:50.240 bottom line is student achievement
00:06:53.120 and we need to continue to work on it we
00:06:55.440 need to focus in an area
00:06:57.360 we need to grow in that area and as we
00:07:00.479 see growth in that area we need to
00:07:02.479 identify another area
00:07:04.720 so that we can continue to build on
00:07:08.720 techniques strategies that can
00:07:11.759 equal success for children
00:07:16.960 all right he felt sick to his stomach
00:07:18.880 because how do we want to write that
00:07:21.360 because what it what
00:07:25.360 it smelled hot it smelled somebody had a
00:07:29.440 good adjective
00:07:30.720 what was that one you used earlier it
00:07:33.199 smells
00:07:33.840 disgusting disgusting okay
00:07:38.479 what you're watching now is the end
00:07:40.160 result of previous staff development
00:07:43.599 teacher diane thompkinson was looking
00:07:45.680 for active listening techniques
00:07:48.000 a staff development expert from outside
00:07:50.080 the school showed her how to use an
00:07:52.000 instructional technique called
00:07:53.680 story painter the children paint a
00:07:57.120 picture to present
00:07:58.000 their vision of what a story is about
00:08:00.639 and
00:08:01.039 you get a lot better listening skills
00:08:03.440 when they try to imagine
00:08:05.599 what is going on in the story and
00:08:07.039 particularly when they know they're
00:08:08.000 going to have an opportunity
00:08:09.280 to paint their favorite part and that we
00:08:11.759 are going to work with a story
00:08:13.680 and describe that chapter what do you
00:08:16.319 want to say about
00:08:17.280 chapter three what do you think sabun
00:08:19.360 was illustrating here
00:08:21.280 because story painter works so well in
00:08:23.440 diane tomkinson's class
00:08:25.280 joan doerr of the academic achievement
00:08:27.440 office has come to alki
00:08:29.360 school to share the process with others
00:08:32.159 the student got up
00:08:33.360 and told about the cat
00:08:36.958 in the first chapter the other students
00:08:39.760 added information
00:08:41.919 and together then with the teacher
00:08:44.399 modeling and the students directing
00:08:46.480 you know this sequence this sequence
00:08:49.120 this
00:08:49.600 is the summary of the first chapter that
00:08:52.080 they came up with
00:08:54.000 now what i'd like to do is have us try
00:08:57.680 it a little bit
00:09:01.040 and see if we can do it because that's
00:09:03.040 the best way to
00:09:04.480 to get something ingrained then i'll
00:09:06.720 show you some examples
00:09:08.000 of what diane's first grade children did
00:09:10.399 with this same idea
00:09:13.680 oh this is your medium
00:09:18.320 and while we're looking at them
00:09:21.360 maybe this thought could go through your
00:09:22.959 mind
00:09:24.800 look no one is alike
00:09:28.080 if we had just one story painter what
00:09:31.200 would the process be
00:09:34.720 if all the children were listening but
00:09:36.320 we had asked just one person to draw
00:09:42.720 right so you would tell us about your
00:09:44.880 picture you want to tell us something
00:09:46.640 about your picture
00:09:49.600 i didn't mean it it to be a gotcha but
00:09:53.920 well i drew a picture of milo sitting in
00:09:55.600 this chair and he was very dejected
00:09:57.279 until he saw the
00:09:58.560 package which has his name on it
00:10:01.839 now we've had some actual examples
00:10:05.600 um to show you we've tried it ourselves
00:10:08.480 the next little part before we finish
00:10:10.320 i'd like you to help i've thought of
00:10:12.800 some but i'm not going to tell you first
00:10:14.560 i'd like you to think of some variations
00:10:18.079 what could you what else could you do
00:10:20.240 with this idea
00:10:21.839 this doesn't have to do with art though
00:10:23.440 but uh sound effects
00:10:26.720 you know while you're reading the story
00:10:28.720 and then the kid i mean kids
00:10:30.399 all make fabulous sounds but you know
00:10:32.959 it's right
00:10:33.680 like they're not supposed to and uh
00:10:37.040 whatever does she mean and it gives them
00:10:40.000 an opportunity to really come out with
00:10:42.000 those great sounds and you read a story
00:10:44.000 and
00:10:44.399 you know the kid that makes the great
00:10:45.760 airplane noise can be the airplane and
00:10:48.320 it's a lot of fun they like doing that
00:10:52.000 a poem right and mary what kind of
00:10:55.680 poem would we choose in workshops like
00:10:58.160 this
00:10:58.800 teachers are learning new strategies for
00:11:00.959 getting students involved
00:11:03.839 you know i'm doing that terrible teacher
00:11:05.120 thing of having something in my head and
00:11:06.399 wanting mary to say it
00:11:08.800 give me a clue
00:11:11.920 for diane tompkinson these opportunities
00:11:14.399 to share teaching methods
00:11:16.000 are what staff development is all about
00:11:19.120 the more strategies and methods you have
00:11:21.440 the more children you reach
00:11:23.040 and the more interesting it becomes and
00:11:25.279 i think that's a key thing we're finding
00:11:27.120 nowadays is letting children know there
00:11:29.680 is more than one path to the house
00:11:32.399 and they're all acceptable and
00:11:34.399 appropriate
00:11:35.600 and so that you have children taking
00:11:37.600 risks in learning
00:11:39.680 you have you have a lot more staff
00:11:41.279 taking risks you see
00:11:43.040 there's so many things at work and it's
00:11:46.160 exciting to try out
00:11:47.200 a wider variety
00:11:58.560 good staff development is ongoing
00:12:01.839 it's not a one-shot thing where they're
00:12:04.079 called into the
00:12:05.360 library the media center or to the
00:12:06.959 auditorium to hear one speaker
00:12:09.440 for 30 minutes if they hear something
00:12:13.200 i'm always right there with them so that
00:12:16.079 i know what they've heard
00:12:17.920 and as a result of their hearing that
00:12:20.320 the expectation is
00:12:22.160 that they go back into the classroom and
00:12:24.240 put that into practice
00:12:26.079 luis said something that that she
00:12:28.160 probably didn't even realize she said
00:12:29.920 that i think is a really critical
00:12:31.760 element and that is that when
00:12:34.000 when teachers are having staff
00:12:36.320 development
00:12:37.200 the principles there with
00:12:40.480 and very often you see the opposite of
00:12:43.760 that the principal introduces the
00:12:45.279 speaker and then they disappear to the
00:12:46.880 office
00:12:47.680 there are even those that suggest that
00:12:49.120 all of the money that we currently
00:12:50.800 invest in workshops and courses and in
00:12:54.000 service day programs
00:12:55.680 should just be diverted to creating
00:12:57.360 opportunities for teachers
00:12:58.959 to share to problem solve together to
00:13:01.120 observe each other to teach each other
00:13:03.440 and i think part of the process has to
00:13:05.279 be the education that
00:13:07.120 it is a process it's not an event
00:13:10.480 change is not a thing it's it's it's an
00:13:14.079 ongoing process that takes time
00:13:26.800 but you have to work on that too if
00:13:28.639 you're going to insult people
00:13:30.399 if you're going to tell vaughn something
00:13:31.920 bad about her mother do you think
00:13:33.200 vaughn's going to want to be your friend
00:13:35.839 gary tubbs is a hands-on principal at
00:13:38.800 beacon hill school
00:13:40.079 tub spends a large part of every day on
00:13:42.240 staff development
00:13:44.880 he visits classrooms gets involved with
00:13:47.279 his teachers and students
00:13:48.959 and even teaches an occasional class
00:13:53.120 here he demonstrates a lesson featuring
00:13:55.440 integrated learning
00:13:56.480 to some new teachers as the teachers
00:13:58.880 watch
00:13:59.519 tubbs leads the class through analysis
00:14:01.680 of their lunch menu
00:14:03.360 well everybody please click on your
00:14:05.600 brains
00:14:06.959 because you're going to use every part
00:14:08.480 of your brain for this lesson make sure
00:14:10.320 you keep your eyes up here
00:14:12.320 you practice reading this to your
00:14:13.600 neighbor as soon as you get it if you
00:14:15.360 get stuck on a word
00:14:16.720 raise your hand and what i want you to
00:14:19.120 do
00:14:19.760 is think about the lunch menu
00:14:23.279 and draw a quick picture sophia's
00:14:26.160 already gotten started she's zipping
00:14:27.839 into it
00:14:28.560 why do you think it's a dairy food
00:14:32.639 cheese it is cheese but why is it a
00:14:34.959 dairy food then
00:14:36.079 it's made from milk it's made from milk
00:14:39.760 that's right
00:14:40.880 cheese comes from milk so you're
00:14:43.680 absolutely right
00:14:45.040 cheese goes here with our dairy we don't
00:14:47.199 have enough information to analyze spicy
00:14:49.519 bar
00:14:50.079 but today your homework when you get
00:14:52.800 your lunch today
00:14:54.720 and you look at the potato with cheese
00:14:57.680 sauce
00:14:58.079 you know what food groups they came from
00:14:59.680 you know where the milk comes from what
00:15:01.279 food group
00:15:02.240 you know where the salad comes from you
00:15:04.399 know where the cornmeal comes from
00:15:06.240 but when you get your spicy bar will you
00:15:09.040 please
00:15:09.440 analyze it and then you tell me later in
00:15:12.399 the day during lunch time or this
00:15:13.920 afternoon
00:15:15.040 where what food group you think the
00:15:18.000 spicy bar belongs to will you analyze it
00:15:20.480 for me please
00:15:24.839 okay
00:15:26.000 they never quit do they
00:15:29.120 down after lunch the students analyzed
00:15:31.920 the assignment
00:15:32.880 the spicy bar the flour
00:15:37.759 do you think this is made out of some
00:15:39.040 kind of flour that's mixed into a dough
00:15:42.320 and then what do you do with it after
00:15:43.759 it's mixed into a dough
00:15:45.920 all right so we analyzed the spicy bar
00:15:49.360 you were good scientist and now we know
00:15:52.480 that the spicy bar belongs to the bread
00:15:55.440 food group
00:15:56.639 good investigation i like to get back
00:15:58.079 into teaching because
00:16:00.000 it feels like the right thing to do it
00:16:02.160 keeps my skills sharp so that i can be a
00:16:04.240 better supervisor for the teachers on my
00:16:06.079 staff
00:16:07.040 it raises my level of credibility with
00:16:09.440 the staff because i'm willing to get up
00:16:10.880 and teach at a moment's notice and work
00:16:12.560 with their kids and get right down on
00:16:14.399 the carpet with the kids and
00:16:16.000 i'm able to then go in and evaluate a
00:16:18.000 difficult situation
00:16:19.360 because i've been there myself i can
00:16:21.120 help teachers learn to become
00:16:22.279 self-evaluators
00:16:23.839 because teaching is close enough to me
00:16:26.480 i've done it recently enough that
00:16:28.399 i'm able to talk at a level that i don't
00:16:30.639 feel like i'm talking down to them
00:16:39.279 at the schools we've seen so far
00:16:41.360 teachers are encouraged to grow
00:16:43.040 professionally
00:16:44.160 they are supported by their colleagues
00:16:46.639 and the principal gets involved in staff
00:16:48.880 development
00:16:49.759 by recognizing what teachers need and
00:16:52.560 providing
00:16:53.199 opportunities for growth
00:16:56.959 it's an average day for these teachers
00:16:58.959 at new suncook school in level maine
00:17:07.199 up to their elbows in mud searching
00:17:09.439 carefully through the muck
00:17:10.880 to see who can find the most interesting
00:17:13.039 bugs
00:17:16.079 well okay they don't do this every day
00:17:18.000 what is he i don't know go get go get
00:17:20.000 the feet
00:17:21.919 someone to walk up and get it and then
00:17:23.280 read it to the group
00:17:25.199 today lori kinsey a local
00:17:27.520 conservationist
00:17:28.559 is leading the teachers and their
00:17:30.080 principal on a tour of a bog
00:17:32.240 near the school she's helping the
00:17:34.160 teachers prepare a unit on wetlands
00:17:37.280 and these wetlands are stop-over points
00:17:39.200 for them along the way
00:17:40.960 yeah next year's water and we're
00:17:44.000 breaking it down into a wetlands study
00:17:46.400 for one quarter of the
00:17:48.000 of the year would be a wetland study and
00:17:51.039 so that we could have kids involved
00:17:53.520 maybe more than just what
00:17:54.880 what our own experiences are at the bog
00:17:57.039 to make sure that they're
00:17:58.480 getting some different things that maybe
00:18:00.080 we wouldn't have gotten on our own
00:18:01.600 i think a lot of us because we live
00:18:03.039 around here have explored it but not in
00:18:04.880 the city
00:18:05.679 we've brought kids down here and uh i've
00:18:08.640 i've never did that i've never done this
00:18:10.480 yeah so you just bring a little more
00:18:13.039 structure or something to it what can we
00:18:14.400 do once we get down here
00:18:15.840 the teachers really contractually are
00:18:18.320 obligated only to be
00:18:20.080 um within the school from 7 30 to 2 30
00:18:23.600 but certainly in a school like new sun
00:18:25.520 cook and i think a lot of schools for
00:18:26.880 this really committed people
00:18:28.640 these people are out on their own
00:18:30.080 they're involved in their staff
00:18:31.520 development activity
00:18:33.280 they can relate back to the classroom
00:18:34.720 and can relate to trying to make better
00:18:36.640 things for kids in classrooms so
00:18:38.880 it's a situation beyond what you see as
00:18:41.520 far as the people here is the reality
00:18:43.679 that they're going back tonight and
00:18:46.160 still having to prepare for tomorrow
00:18:47.840 and this happens all the time
00:18:51.280 what do you think these teachers learned
00:18:52.880 about each other and about themselves
00:18:54.840 today
00:18:58.160 a day in the bog it's no picnic but
00:19:00.799 these teachers enjoyed it
00:19:02.320 and grew from the experience it just
00:19:05.120 makes the year
00:19:05.919 go better for the kids and also for me
00:19:08.400 so anything i can do to help my year go
00:19:10.400 better is certainly worthwhile
00:19:11.840 also staff development is a means to an
00:19:16.799 end the end result being a successful
00:19:19.440 school
00:19:20.160 with successful students in the schools
00:19:22.880 we've just seen
00:19:24.160 staff development is an integral part of
00:19:26.880 the school's mission and culture
00:19:29.039 it is practical ongoing and full of
00:19:31.840 opportunities for teacher growth
00:19:34.160 but most of all it's about improving the
00:19:36.720 instruction for every student
00:19:38.880 in every class i really have a chance to
00:19:41.919 grow professionally
00:19:43.360 i have had a really rich experience in
00:19:45.440 this building because of that
00:19:47.280 and the more i learn
00:19:50.320 the more i try i demonstrate i share
00:19:53.360 the more other people share with me the
00:19:55.120 richer the whole school gets
00:19:57.200 so that's been really nice okay looking
00:19:59.840 right up here
00:20:01.520 pretend it's the 12th of june everybody
00:20:03.600 looking right up here one
00:20:04.880 two three


00:20:34.660 
00:20:41.120 we're only here for one reason and that
00:20:42.720 is to educate children
00:20:44.799 and i'm responsible for the education of
00:20:47.200 every single child that enters
00:20:49.760 the escape they have entered my spirit
00:20:51.440 of life so i am responsible for it and i
00:20:54.000 need to provide the climate
00:20:56.559 uh the environment where learning can
00:20:58.960 take place
00:21:14.840 do
00:21:24.720 at each highly successful school we
00:21:26.640 visited outstanding leadership
00:21:28.960 is critical to the school's success in
00:21:31.760 this program we'll examine
00:21:33.120 instructional leadership another program
00:21:35.600 will look at other aspects of leadership
00:21:39.039 in high achieving schools the principal
00:21:41.280 is usually the instructional leader
00:21:43.600 we wanted to know how do these
00:21:45.600 principles improve instruction
00:21:48.000 how do they motivate teachers and
00:21:49.679 students and how do they create a
00:21:52.000 culture of success
00:21:53.360 in their schools
00:21:59.030 
00:22:04.320 thou shalt educate every child
00:22:13.919 imagine a school called euclid avenue
00:22:16.159 elementary in east los angeles
00:22:18.799 it is dirty dangerous one of the lowest
00:22:21.520 achieving schools in the city
00:22:23.919 now imagine that someone calls and says
00:22:26.159 you are to leave your successful school
00:22:28.960 and become the new principal at euclid
00:22:31.760 it happened to esther mcshane
00:22:34.400 i actually thought it was a joke i
00:22:36.400 resisted i said i'm not coming
00:22:39.440 and i was told i'll meet you there at 10
00:22:41.600 30 the next morning
00:22:43.200 and it certainly was a shock i didn't
00:22:45.679 want to be here
00:22:46.880 i wasn't looking for another challenge
00:22:49.560 
00:22:50.799 ruth johnson of the california
00:22:52.400 achievement council understood
00:22:54.000 the problems at euclid there was racial
00:22:56.480 tension
00:22:58.000 there was tension of teachers that
00:23:01.360 were not talking to each other in the
00:23:03.440 halls
00:23:05.039 there was no focus on looking at kids
00:23:08.159 and achievement
00:23:09.840 it was a fractured school very
00:23:11.520 fragmented
00:23:14.080 throw things out the car absolutely that
00:23:16.400 we're going to have we're going to have
00:23:17.440 the cleanest highways in the world with
00:23:19.520 the kids in this classroom
00:23:21.039 what else esther mcshane developed a
00:23:22.960 clear mission for her new school
00:23:25.120 academic success for every child
00:23:29.600 that meant cleaning up the campus
00:23:32.559 improving instruction
00:23:34.000 and increasing student achievement
00:23:37.200 i have made a difference because i have
00:23:40.159 empowered people
00:23:42.159 are you ready for them yeah okay they
00:23:44.640 didn't believe that they were excellent
00:23:46.080 teachers they didn't believe that they
00:23:47.440 were capable
00:23:48.640 of raising children's scores they didn't
00:23:50.640 believe that they could have
00:23:52.240 law and order in a school the culture of
00:23:54.799 the school has changed
00:23:56.640 the school is now focused on student
00:23:59.039 achievement
00:24:00.559 there's a curriculum focused teachers
00:24:02.640 are practicing
00:24:04.480 and implementing new ways of teaching
00:24:06.720 and learning
00:24:07.760 and that to me is critical if the school
00:24:10.720 is going to move on
00:24:12.480 it's the beginning of it say it
00:24:15.039 minnesota
00:24:15.919 all right i wouldn't trade this school
00:24:19.200 for a minute now
00:24:20.240 not for a minute
00:24:23.360 each of our principles started with the
00:24:25.039 belief that all students could succeed
00:24:27.760 that belief became the focus of the
00:24:29.360 school's mission a mission these
00:24:31.279 principles communicated clearly and
00:24:33.440 relentlessly
00:24:35.440 i think that if someone has the
00:24:38.559 belief that these kids can absolutely
00:24:43.919 learn and are capable of doing
00:24:46.159 everything that you
00:24:47.360 want them to do then you set about doing
00:24:49.840 that and if you continuously
00:24:52.080 monitor it continuously talk about it
00:24:55.679 continuously get your philosophy out
00:24:58.880 with parents with community with
00:25:01.600 teachers
00:25:02.320 and with students then everything will
00:25:04.400 be fine
00:25:06.150 
00:25:10.559 and that sums up the lesson for today
00:25:18.000 what is a schemer again ernie
00:25:23.120 right a plotter or planner who and our
00:25:26.080 story
00:25:26.799 is managing instruction is one of the
00:25:28.720 effective principal's most important
00:25:30.480 jobs
00:25:32.400 we've come to bennett q elementary in
00:25:34.240 englewood california
00:25:35.600 to meet a principal with a knack for
00:25:37.440 designing and implementing curriculum
00:25:39.840 her name is nancy ishinaga we
00:25:43.200 have worked out a system where
00:25:46.480 everybody goes through everybody is
00:25:49.360 taught
00:25:49.760 specific things that make them
00:25:51.440 successful student and
00:25:53.200 it's what every teacher does tell us
00:25:56.559 about this picture right over here
00:25:59.279 it's a car okay tell us how many red
00:26:01.919 blocks and how many white blocks you
00:26:03.520 used
00:26:08.720 good for you how about this one right
00:26:11.120 over here this looks interesting
00:26:16.559 right you didn't use any whites there
00:26:18.480 right what did you build here what can
00:26:20.240 we call the curriculum at bennett q
00:26:22.080 is sequenced beginning in kindergarten
00:26:24.400 up through the sixth grade
00:26:26.400 every child progresses from blocks
00:26:30.080 to abstract concepts like diameters
00:26:33.120 and fractions that they multiplied
00:26:35.600 everybody would you multiply by here
00:26:37.039 under this system each grade builds on
00:26:39.039 the success of previous grades
00:26:40.799 all right very good nancy ishinaga
00:26:44.480 believes in her sequenced curriculum
00:26:47.039 she carefully monitors to make sure it's
00:26:48.960 being taught and being learned
00:26:51.120 in other words we have a very
00:26:52.240 well-defined curriculum
00:26:54.640 and i monitor what
00:26:57.760 happens in the classrooms by periodic
00:27:01.039 tests which the teachers all give and
00:27:03.279 every teacher in every grade level gives
00:27:04.799 the same tasks
00:27:05.919 they turn in the results to me and we go
00:27:09.120 over them together to see where
00:27:11.279 strengths and weaknesses might be where
00:27:13.840 changes in the tests or changes in the
00:27:16.080 curriculum
00:27:17.200 need to be made question
00:27:21.039 do you think templeton enjoyed the fair
00:27:23.440 thumbs up if you think he enjoyed it
00:27:25.200 thumbs down if you think he didn't enjoy
00:27:27.279 it
00:27:28.720 thanks um i agree with all of you who
00:27:31.760 can tell me why you think he
00:27:33.760 enjoys our test scores she cares about
00:27:35.840 them she'd call you in and say
00:27:37.520 have you thought about working in this
00:27:38.960 area watch someone else teach vocabulary
00:27:41.360 and you do a lot better when i first
00:27:42.880 started
00:27:43.520 my vocabulary scores were low and she
00:27:45.760 said
00:27:47.600 what do you want to do but i said okay
00:27:48.880 i'll i'll really make an emphasis next
00:27:50.799 year i'll work extra hard on vocabulary
00:27:52.640 with my kids
00:27:53.520 and so it works
00:27:57.279 normally but we talk more which is nice
00:27:59.039 but that's okay because
00:28:00.480 we identified problems my job is to make
00:28:03.600 sure that the teacher
00:28:04.960 is given the wherewithal to be
00:28:06.960 successful
00:28:08.240 and the teacher's job is to give
00:28:10.159 everything to her kids
00:28:11.760 to make them become successful so there
00:28:14.000 is this internal consistency
00:28:16.399 and i would like to reiterate the fact
00:28:18.880 that we do have a system
00:28:20.559 so that any school
00:28:23.600 which wants to succeed can do this it's
00:28:26.320 not a matter of personalities it's a
00:28:28.799 matter of having a system by which
00:28:31.279 we educate our kids
00:28:38.080 i'd like to overwhelm them with
00:28:39.600 instructional excellence but i'm not
00:28:41.600 above winning through intimidation
00:28:48.000 and raise your hands you could tell me
00:28:49.840 if i had 49
00:28:52.000 who could raise your hand give me a
00:28:53.039 power form single 49 what powerful would
00:28:55.760 give you 489 we got nicholas knows like
00:28:57.840 tanya
00:28:58.799 and effective school leaders create
00:29:01.039 environments that encourage
00:29:02.399 learning and inspire teachers when
00:29:05.039 louise smith was principal of rice
00:29:06.880 school in dallas
00:29:08.080 the sheer force of her personality
00:29:10.080 created a world inside these walls
00:29:12.159 that left no avenue but achievement i
00:29:15.039 have very high standards for myself
00:29:17.039 first and for everyone else around me
00:29:20.399 and i will not lower those standards for
00:29:22.080 anyone the first word
00:29:23.919 is scarce if i say that a resource
00:29:27.120 is scarce what do i mean by that
00:29:30.399 gold is scarce so people pay a high
00:29:33.600 price for it these days
00:29:35.120 kenneth what is scarce well
00:29:38.320 she is dogged in her pursuit of
00:29:41.600 excellence
00:29:42.640 she lays the cards on the table when she
00:29:44.480 interviews you if
00:29:45.679 you cannot meet her expectations there
00:29:48.240 are no hard feelings
00:29:49.679 but you'll have to find another place to
00:29:52.840 go because the children are her priority
00:29:56.159 even though you may develop a wonderful
00:29:57.760 working relationship with her
00:29:59.520 and be her friend if you you're not
00:30:01.919 serving the children
00:30:03.039 to the best of what she knows your
00:30:04.399 capabilities to be
00:30:06.080 then you don't belong here i'm very
00:30:08.240 uncomfortable with mediocrity
00:30:10.320 if i find people who are satisfied with
00:30:12.399 mediocrity then i stay away from them
00:30:14.960 because uh that that's my discomfort
00:30:18.240 zone
00:30:19.039 when i see people who are just satisfied
00:30:21.200 with just status quo
00:30:23.039 i'm not satisfied with status quo it has
00:30:25.440 to be way
00:30:26.480 above and beyond status quo to satisfy
00:30:29.360 me
00:30:31.039 effective instructional leaders are
00:30:32.880 highly visible around their schools
00:30:35.440 nancy ishinaga at bennett q plays many
00:30:37.760 different roles
00:30:38.960 crossing guard cafeteria worker hallway
00:30:42.320 monitor
00:30:43.039 and always always instructional leader
00:30:45.840 of the school
00:30:47.360 she sets the tone for the whole school
00:30:49.600 she's a hard worker from
00:30:51.279 crossing guard to cafeteria duty to
00:30:54.480 you name it nancy does it so she sets
00:30:57.440 the tone by herself
00:30:58.960 working extremely hard and and again she
00:31:02.159 expects for her teachers to
00:31:04.000 to do well we're held accountable for
00:31:06.240 what happens in our classroom
00:31:08.080 my job is not to be the big boss of the
00:31:10.240 big honcho who orders everybody around
00:31:12.880 granted i am a little bossy
00:31:16.880 and i'm not that patient but i think i
00:31:20.399 have a very good
00:31:21.919 idea and a feeling of what a school
00:31:24.960 should be like
00:31:27.919 and i try to do that
00:31:31.120 good morning boys and girls
00:31:36.320 i want to welcome you to van spirit days
00:31:40.399 you've so often heard me say that i'm
00:31:42.880 very proud to be the principal of ann
00:31:45.200 school
00:31:46.559 because to me band school is very
00:31:48.880 special
00:31:50.080 besides setting a good example effective
00:31:52.399 leaders also motivate their students
00:31:54.399 and teachers to succeed this is not a
00:31:57.440 pep session advanced school this is
00:31:59.360 spirit day
00:32:00.559 a celebration of teaching and learning
00:32:03.150 
00:32:10.080 you know it's not always easy to be good
00:32:13.519 but jarrell has put forth a great effort
00:32:16.880 to improve his behavior and his
00:32:19.360 achievement
00:32:20.480 and of course that is due to the
00:32:23.360 cooperation
00:32:24.640 that we have received from his mother
00:32:26.880 and grandmother
00:32:28.000 thank you for your support doris brevard
00:32:30.880 conceives spirit day to motivate and
00:32:32.880 honor those students and teachers
00:32:34.640 who live the school's mission academic
00:32:37.279 success
00:32:38.080 for all students
00:32:41.120 across the country from van is beacon
00:32:43.600 hill school in seattle
00:32:45.919 like other effective leaders principal
00:32:47.840 gary tubbs supports professional growth
00:32:50.080 for his staff
00:32:51.679 here he uses a hands-on approach by
00:32:53.840 demonstrating a lesson for a new teacher
00:32:56.080 any ideas why i said those foods
00:32:59.279 chocolate what milk was milk on the menu
00:33:04.880 what milk was on the was milk on the
00:33:06.399 menu how many think milk was on the menu
00:33:09.840 milk was on the menu so i'm gonna put
00:33:11.440 that up here
00:33:14.720 milk smell milk for me
00:33:18.080 raises my level of credibility with the
00:33:19.760 staff because i'm willing to get up and
00:33:21.200 teach at a moment's notice and work with
00:33:22.960 their kids and get right down on the
00:33:24.799 carpet with the kids and
00:33:26.640 and i'm able to then go in and evaluate
00:33:30.080 a difficult situation
00:33:31.600 because i've been there myself
00:33:34.720 i can help teachers learn to become
00:33:36.200 self-evaluators because
00:33:38.240 teaching is close enough to me i've done
00:33:40.720 it recently enough that
00:33:42.240 i'm able to talk at a level that i don't
00:33:44.480 feel like i'm talking down to them
00:33:46.320 who do you think that you should design
00:33:47.840 this robot for should you buy
00:33:50.399 if the fire company desiree had an idea
00:33:52.320 about children
00:33:53.760 gretchen jacobson teaches at beacon hill
00:33:56.640 she admires gary tubbs for his
00:33:58.399 leadership
00:33:59.120 and his support he's incredibly
00:34:01.679 supportive
00:34:02.640 he really knows how to motivate if i was
00:34:04.720 having a problem in my classroom i'd
00:34:06.320 come and say
00:34:07.519 okay gary this is going on and he would
00:34:10.800 ask me questions and get me to reflect
00:34:13.599 on what i'm doing right
00:34:15.359 what i think i need work on and then how
00:34:17.359 can we solve that
00:34:18.560 and you sometimes give solutions too
00:34:20.399 that i would go back to my classroom and
00:34:22.560 try
00:34:23.599 so he was not only encouraging he was a
00:34:26.560 good problem solver too
00:34:34.239 you'll find the principal really
00:34:36.000 believes in teacher support
00:34:37.800 
00:34:42.079 mrs digger we got we finally found
00:34:45.280 an aunt that's going to pick up bass
00:34:47.440 like other instructional leaders
00:34:49.359 then principal doris brevard supports
00:34:51.520 her teachers in many ways
00:34:53.599 for example she has enforced strict
00:34:55.839 discipline at her school for over 20
00:34:57.760 years
00:34:58.720 the policy is designed to maximize the
00:35:00.880 amount of time teachers have for
00:35:02.560 instruction
00:35:03.680 the principal must provide the
00:35:05.680 atmosphere and then it's the teacher's
00:35:07.760 job to teach
00:35:10.000 but if that teacher can go into his or
00:35:12.720 her classroom
00:35:13.760 and teach 35 minutes of the 40-minute
00:35:16.960 period then something will be
00:35:18.960 accomplished
00:35:20.240 but the principal must see to it that
00:35:22.560 the discipline throughout the building
00:35:24.640 is such that the teacher can teach the
00:35:27.440 35 minutes
00:35:28.880 okay the elephant and the bad baby and
00:35:31.839 guess what
00:35:34.160 this is one of those stories where i
00:35:36.160 need some helpers
00:35:37.599 who would like to be a helper you're
00:35:39.760 gonna help me read the story
00:35:40.960 yeah great well i'll tell you when it's
00:35:43.280 your part
00:35:44.079 okay once upon a time
00:35:47.119 i know that when i go in my room i will
00:35:50.079 have an atmosphere in which i can teach
00:35:53.119 and i think one of the one of the things
00:35:55.599 i always remember when i first came to
00:35:57.280 van she said to me you can teach
00:35:58.960 whatever style you like your style is
00:36:01.119 your style
00:36:02.400 and as long as you're teaching and
00:36:03.839 children are learning that's all i ask
00:36:06.160 of you
00:36:07.599 and she also told me that when i go in
00:36:10.320 my room to teach
00:36:11.280 i will have an atmosphere in which i can
00:36:13.440 teach
00:36:14.480 and if i don't have that atmosphere then
00:36:17.280 that's her job to provide it for me and
00:36:19.200 i have
00:36:19.680 it's always been provided for me just
00:36:21.839 like you have a guest in your besides
00:36:23.280 creating orderly environments for their
00:36:25.280 teachers
00:36:26.079 effective leaders build cohesion and
00:36:28.320 cooperation
00:36:29.599 okay thank you thank you you know i'm
00:36:32.880 doing that terrible teacher thing of
00:36:34.160 having something in my head and wanting
00:36:35.440 mary to say it
00:36:36.960 how can i principal pat sander
00:36:38.720 encourages teamwork among her teachers
00:36:41.280 she creates staff development
00:36:42.800 opportunities to get everyone talking
00:36:44.720 and sharing their knowledge i think in
00:36:47.040 the traditional school the
00:36:48.880 principal is the boss is the person who
00:36:52.240 okays what you want to do the person you
00:36:55.280 must see
00:36:56.079 you must clear things with at al-qaeda
00:36:59.280 the principle is a team player a
00:37:03.520 person who works collaborative with you
00:37:05.839 and other staff members
00:37:07.280 to see that what you want to do with
00:37:10.160 kids
00:37:11.119 occurs facilitates foster
00:37:14.160 supports that happens here every day
00:37:18.480 it's really nice to hear particularly
00:37:21.680 parents who are still a few years away
00:37:24.000 from coming up to school
00:37:25.520 and that they're really are interested
00:37:27.920 in what's happening at the new suncook
00:37:29.280 school in level maine
00:37:30.960 parents are meeting with principal gary
00:37:32.720 mcdonald
00:37:34.079 their children aren't even in school yet
00:37:36.079 but mcdonald believes it's crucial to
00:37:37.760 get parents involved early
00:37:39.680 he wants them to understand and support
00:37:41.680 the school's mission
00:37:43.280 once the kids are all done mostly age
00:37:45.200 they go into third grade now that's
00:37:46.880 regular third grade or do they also do
00:37:49.040 this they don't do
00:37:50.560 they don't have the multi-age third
00:37:52.160 fourth and fifth the multi-age
00:37:54.480 we think enhances the type of
00:37:55.920 instruction that we're providing
00:37:57.680 but that's not the answer the multi-age
00:37:59.520 is not the
00:38:00.800 uh by itself what makes it a quality
00:38:03.040 program it's what happens between
00:38:04.800 teacher and child
00:38:06.720 so when they move on to third grade
00:38:09.119 though you won't see the same
00:38:10.240 arrangement of grades in other words
00:38:11.520 they'll be
00:38:11.920 parents to me and to the entire staff
00:38:14.560 here are seen
00:38:15.520 as being tremendous value they're um
00:38:18.640 they're welcome at all times and they're
00:38:21.440 a
00:38:21.839 uh we try to provide them with the with
00:38:24.800 the knowledge
00:38:25.520 and the opportunities that they can
00:38:27.520 really feel an integral part of the
00:38:29.119 building
00:38:29.920 and they raise excellent questions that
00:38:31.440 cause us to again focus
00:38:33.280 and um sometimes give a perspective
00:38:36.640 that's extremely valuable to us
00:38:43.359 he wanted them valerie wilfong has a son
00:38:46.400 at new suncook school
00:38:47.920 and she volunteers as a teacher's aide
00:38:50.560 she got involved with the school after
00:38:52.240 meeting principal gary mcdonald
00:38:55.440 i mean right from the very beginning we
00:38:57.359 were welcomed in before christian
00:38:58.960 started kindergarten
00:39:00.000 and very open policy we want you to be a
00:39:02.480 part of what's happening really a
00:39:03.839 partnership
00:39:04.960 happening here and and that was
00:39:06.560 wonderful for us
00:39:09.520 strong instructional leadership is one
00:39:11.839 key to a highly successful school
00:39:14.400 instructional leaders are willing to do
00:39:16.320 anything it takes
00:39:17.440 to achieve academic success they develop
00:39:20.640 and communicate a mission
00:39:22.560 promote quality instruction and create
00:39:25.359 supportive environments for teaching
00:39:27.359 and learning above all else they are
00:39:30.800 single-minded in their devotion to
00:39:32.880 success for every child
00:39:34.560 the passion comes from the light that
00:39:36.800 comes on in
00:39:37.599 in the little boy's eyes when you
00:39:39.280 finally get something or
00:39:40.880 or the little girl who eventually learns
00:39:44.079 that
00:39:44.960 i'm just as smart as anybody else it
00:39:47.040 sounds philosophical and it sounds
00:39:48.960 maybe it sounds corny to some people but
00:39:51.280 we're here for a reason
00:39:52.720 and i don't want life to come to an end
00:39:54.640 and feel like i haven't made a
00:39:55.760 difference in the lives of the children


00:40:27.839 if you have a few seconds we'll show you
00:40:29.839 everything we learned about school
00:40:36.839 leadership
00:40:40.480 oh you want the long version stay tuned
00:41:04.160 why so we so you can be aware
00:41:07.920 of what college life is all about what
00:41:10.400 are you in
00:41:11.119 at each highly successful school we
00:41:13.040 visited outstanding leadership
00:41:15.119 is crucial to the school's success in
00:41:18.000 this program we'll examine
00:41:19.440 school leadership another program will
00:41:22.079 look at instructional leadership
00:41:26.720 in these schools the principal was the
00:41:28.800 school leader
00:41:30.240 we wanted to know what do these
00:41:32.079 principles do that makes them highly
00:41:34.240 effective school leaders
00:41:36.000 what are their priorities and what
00:41:37.920 characteristics do they share
00:41:48.079 mr housener the principal would like to
00:41:50.480 see you
00:41:51.280 after class
00:41:54.319 because this is next week in highly
00:41:56.079 effective schools principals are closely
00:41:58.480 involved in selecting teachers
00:42:00.560 and replacing them if necessary
00:42:03.920 louise smith is the former principal of
00:42:06.000 rice school in dallas
00:42:09.520 i tried to interview every teacher who
00:42:11.920 entered this building because i needed
00:42:13.760 to let them know
00:42:15.280 what the philosophy was of this school
00:42:17.839 and what we were about
00:42:19.280 and if they wanted to buy into that
00:42:21.760 philosophy
00:42:22.800 and if they wanted to buy into that
00:42:24.560 energy level that that we were going to
00:42:26.640 be
00:42:27.680 involved in here because it takes an
00:42:29.760 awful high energy level
00:42:31.760 in order to do this job you see we're
00:42:33.839 consistently working
00:42:35.200 there's no time to just relax
00:42:38.640 read the first sentence for me please
00:42:41.119 and you'll see that it contains
00:42:42.640 dana brooks was one of the teachers
00:42:44.400 louise smith hired
00:42:45.920 after an extensive interview it's the
00:42:48.480 toughest
00:42:50.079 interviewing process that i have gone
00:42:52.240 through
00:42:53.920 and i've been in three school systems
00:42:57.599 now
00:42:58.000 if you have to write an essay you go
00:42:59.839 through extensive interviews
00:43:02.000 but it's worth it it's worth it
00:43:06.000 okay so when dropped on the table the
00:43:08.560 compound ball
00:43:10.079 bounced or the ball bounced you can just
00:43:11.680 say ball that's fine
00:43:13.760 any teacher who interviews with louise
00:43:15.760 smith should listen carefully
00:43:17.920 they will hear about her high
00:43:19.200 expectations
00:43:21.359 and if teachers don't meet those
00:43:22.880 expectations they'll be hearing from
00:43:25.119 louise smith again
00:43:27.920 i call that teacher in and i just tell
00:43:30.000 them uh when we
00:43:31.440 interviewed i told you the kind of place
00:43:33.359 that you were coming to
00:43:34.960 now if you want to change your mind now
00:43:37.760 then fine
00:43:38.800 we'll we'll talk about this but my
00:43:41.040 expectations are still the same
00:43:43.599 for you and everyone else around here
00:43:46.880 we've got to get the kids where they
00:43:49.599 need to be
00:43:50.640 and you've got to carry your weight just
00:43:53.440 as everyone
00:43:54.079 else is around here and that that is
00:43:57.280 something that i will not
00:43:58.800 veer from at all wherever you been one
00:44:01.680 two
00:44:02.560 ready begin where and what happens if
00:44:06.240 teachers still can't meet louise smith's
00:44:08.400 tough standards
00:44:10.079 i never actually had to get rid of a
00:44:12.319 teacher but
00:44:14.400 the way we were able to to get this
00:44:17.359 school on such a high standard
00:44:20.079 some teachers who came saw that they
00:44:22.480 couldn't keep up
00:44:24.079 so they asked to leave you see this is a
00:44:27.440 very very busy place
00:44:29.680 so uh you know some people can't keep up
00:44:32.480 the pace
00:44:33.599 and uh you can see that very quickly
00:44:37.760 if you're here and uh you can't slough
00:44:40.400 off
00:44:40.880 around here you have to work and if
00:44:43.520 you're not willing
00:44:44.720 and able to do that then most of them
00:44:47.920 asked to leave
00:44:53.420 
00:44:57.839 after 23 years at vann's school doris
00:45:01.040 brevard has a reputation
00:45:02.720 as a maverick and risk taker she
00:45:05.760 is an unwavering champion of her
00:45:07.599 students and teachers
00:45:09.440 from the very beginning she has indeed
00:45:11.359 been a risk taker
00:45:13.280 that is that she puts the children at
00:45:15.760 band school
00:45:17.440 above the system all the time
00:45:21.359 she is constantly thinking and aware of
00:45:24.800 what's good for the kids at fan
00:45:26.720 the baby pig i wonder if that's a naming
00:45:29.599 part or a telling part cement
00:45:33.280 here's an example at one time van was a
00:45:36.640 pilot school to test the effectiveness
00:45:38.640 of the lippincott reading series
00:45:40.560 which was based on phonics
00:45:43.839 and we found that at the end of the
00:45:46.720 first year
00:45:48.000 the children in the lippincott series
00:45:50.000 could read just about anything that they
00:45:51.920 picked up
00:45:53.520 so that gave us the idea that this was
00:45:56.400 something that we wanted to use
00:45:59.280 these are the stories john unfortunately
00:46:01.280 for van the school board later dropped
00:46:03.359 the lip and cut series
00:46:04.640 and told doris brevard she could not use
00:46:06.800 it in most schools that would be the end
00:46:09.280 of the story
00:46:10.400 but van is not like most schools it has
00:46:13.200 doris brevard
00:46:14.800 she organized parents and with their
00:46:16.560 support took her argument to the board
00:46:19.280 the board reversed its decision
00:46:23.760 doris brevard does what is best for her
00:46:25.920 school regardless of the consequences
00:46:28.640 like most effective school leaders she's
00:46:30.560 a rebel at heart
00:46:44.720 how many rays does this have i don't
00:46:47.040 know remember we counted them how many
00:46:49.119 does it have
00:46:50.000 it has 20. what did we call it
00:46:53.440 a sunstar why don't you turn it over and
00:46:55.359 see if we can see the tube feet
00:46:57.280 can you see the tube think of a school
00:46:59.359 as an electrical circuit
00:47:01.200 effective school leaders are plugged
00:47:03.040 into that circuit
00:47:04.480 they get involved and monitor what's
00:47:08.839 happening
00:47:11.119 classes from elk high school in seattle
00:47:13.200 are on a beach trip today
00:47:14.880 and principal pat sander has come with
00:47:16.880 them she didn't have to
00:47:18.720 she has plenty to do back at school but
00:47:21.200 her priority is spending time with
00:47:23.119 students
00:47:23.680 and teachers here's this this is a shell
00:47:26.880 you know what happens when the crabs
00:47:28.240 grow
00:47:29.119 they grow right out of their shells they
00:47:30.960 they shed them off and then they grow a
00:47:32.960 new shell so this is one of their old
00:47:34.640 shells that they left here on the beach
00:47:40.160 you'll also find pat sander at staff
00:47:42.319 development meetings
00:47:43.680 she wants to see and hear what her
00:47:45.520 teachers are learning
00:47:46.800 disgusting and plugged and gulped and
00:47:49.520 it's wonderful
00:47:50.640 thanks diane so you didn't have to do
00:47:52.800 that preparation and sometimes
00:47:54.559 you'll even find her in her office all
00:47:57.280 right
00:47:57.839 here she is busy monitoring her students
00:47:59.839 test scores and entering them into her
00:48:01.680 computer
00:48:02.720 and i do that for a couple of reasons
00:48:04.480 one so that i can
00:48:06.400 be a support and a resource to the
00:48:09.040 teachers as we start to look at the
00:48:10.720 instructional approaches and strategies
00:48:13.040 and two so that if a parent walks in and
00:48:15.440 asks a question about their child
00:48:17.359 that i can be knowledgeable and be able
00:48:19.839 to give them some information back also
00:48:22.319 is it feeling any better okay and what's
00:48:25.359 wrong with you
00:48:27.520 where'd that happen um when i was at my
00:48:29.920 best
00:48:30.720 this morning pat sander is plugged into
00:48:33.200 the circuit
00:48:34.160 she is a watcher and a listener all of
00:48:36.800 this monitoring brings her closer to
00:48:38.559 teachers
00:48:39.200 and most important to students and i
00:48:42.319 think that
00:48:43.200 every child has a strength and what we
00:48:44.960 have to do is find that strength
00:48:47.200 capitalize on that and then start to
00:48:49.839 bring about
00:48:50.880 the educational achievements in other
00:48:52.640 areas that may not be the strengths of
00:48:54.319 that child
00:49:07.760 effective school leaders are highly
00:49:09.599 visible around their schools
00:49:11.599 you won't find esther mcshane in her
00:49:13.359 office doing paperwork during school
00:49:15.440 hours
00:49:16.160 she hates paperwork she wants to be
00:49:18.559 close to the action
00:49:20.160 i do not spend my time at all during the
00:49:22.880 day doing paperwork because i don't need
00:49:24.720 to do paperwork
00:49:25.920 the action is in the classroom the
00:49:27.760 action is in the yard
00:49:29.200 the actions in the eating area is
00:49:32.400 i have high needs to be with my students
00:49:35.520 and my staff she's constantly out here
00:49:39.520 talking to children
00:49:40.640 you know you don't see principals doing
00:49:42.800 that she's on the playground before
00:49:45.359 school
00:49:46.160 during recess at lunchtime she's picking
00:49:49.200 up trash
00:49:50.400 and when i see her doing this well by
00:49:53.839 golly
00:49:54.640 i'm going to pick up trash too and i'm
00:49:57.280 going to question
00:49:58.319 children and i'm going to expect for my
00:50:00.559 children to excel
00:50:02.559 i think she must stay here 12 hours a
00:50:04.079 day at least and
00:50:05.839 she is here and she's out there working
00:50:07.680 and the past most administrators that i
00:50:09.680 saw that i have worked with virtually
00:50:12.319 locked himself in their office and had
00:50:13.760 no contact with children she's out there
00:50:15.520 and she's hustling
00:50:16.800 and she cares about the kids and she
00:50:18.480 tries to see tries to get everything
00:50:20.400 available at all possible for our kids
00:50:24.319 it takes an enormous amount of energy to
00:50:26.240 do this job it should say so right on
00:50:28.400 the application
00:50:29.920 esther mcshane is driven she believes
00:50:32.640 there's no other way to achieve
00:50:34.240 excellence
00:50:35.359 but but if i can make arrangements to
00:50:37.359 reschedule that
00:50:38.559 you think you'll learn it back what else
00:50:40.960 are you going to lose
00:50:41.760 but if you have energy and you have high
00:50:44.240 expectation for yourself
00:50:46.000 and for children it just comes it
00:50:48.480 formulates itself
00:50:50.800 and and and needs to be displayed that
00:50:54.079 behavior needs to be
00:50:55.119 every day every minute i mean we're on
00:50:58.240 stage
00:50:59.599 and we're on stage for children
00:51:08.890 
00:51:21.119 to fly slow
00:51:24.240 effective school leaders support the
00:51:26.319 front line troops
00:51:27.599 their teachers this is beacon hill
00:51:30.319 school in seattle
00:51:32.000 principal gary tubbs understands what
00:51:34.240 can happen if teachers don't get any
00:51:36.160 support
00:51:37.040 i think that that is the only way that
00:51:40.000 educators can truly make a difference in
00:51:41.760 the lives of all their children
00:51:43.200 is if within the building they have a
00:51:44.800 sense of support from one another
00:51:46.880 if you're out there on your own you
00:51:48.720 might do really great for a while but
00:51:50.319 you're eventually going to burn out
00:51:51.760 because you can't do it on your own when
00:51:54.319 a student has a behavior problem
00:51:56.240 gary tubbs might call a problem-solving
00:51:58.720 meeting
00:51:59.599 he invites teachers the school's
00:52:01.520 counselor and a family support worker to
00:52:04.000 brainstorm solutions with him
00:52:06.000 yeah but self-esteem is starting to
00:52:07.599 become a real issue
00:52:09.520 we need to talk a little bit about her
00:52:12.079 the interactions that children are
00:52:13.599 having with her
00:52:14.640 and what we can do we've tried giving
00:52:17.440 the child
00:52:18.079 a friend or a buddy before is there
00:52:21.200 someone in maybe one of the other
00:52:22.559 classes
00:52:24.240 that um comes to mind that would
00:52:27.760 be a good buddy for her i think there
00:52:29.520 should be someone in that class there
00:52:31.040 are
00:52:31.359 not a lot of nice children in that class
00:52:33.599 that if we
00:52:34.880 out of this meeting comes a plan to
00:52:36.800 solve the child's problem
00:52:38.640 a plan that beacon hills educators agree
00:52:41.200 on
00:52:41.680 and can implement together probably next
00:52:44.000 week so
00:52:44.880 we got two more calls to possibly go out
00:52:47.920 and speak
00:52:49.119 at stevens and blaine and a south end
00:52:52.559 district will soon be calling us outside
00:52:55.280 effective school leaders
00:52:56.640 also understand the importance of using
00:52:58.720 outside resources
00:53:00.000 to improve their schools one of the most
00:53:02.800 important resources
00:53:03.920 is people especially parents at alki
00:53:07.440 site council meetings
00:53:08.559 principal pat sander listens carefully
00:53:10.640 to what parents have to offer
00:53:12.559 and we've got the capability to do it i
00:53:15.599 think the translation
00:53:16.720 not one of us can do it alone the
00:53:18.240 parents know certainly the most about
00:53:20.079 their children they know more than we do
00:53:22.720 and they have a different perspective on
00:53:24.319 what's beneficial for
00:53:25.839 their kids the staff brings that
00:53:28.319 educational
00:53:29.839 background and professional experience
00:53:32.480 and
00:53:33.119 hopefully i bring the administrative
00:53:35.520 background that can maybe pull it all
00:53:37.440 together
00:53:38.319 we wanted to look at one or the other
00:53:40.880 the second one is the parent survey
00:53:43.920 and last year site council decided site
00:53:47.040 council chairman bill staltzer is also
00:53:49.280 an alki parent
00:53:50.800 you should print it out before you leave
00:53:52.960 you know point out what you have done so
00:53:54.480 far
00:53:54.800 together stahlser and pat sander worked
00:53:57.200 to reorganize the school's computer lab
00:53:59.920 which was rarely used until last year
00:54:02.960 i would say probably of the 330
00:54:05.920 something children in the school last
00:54:07.359 year
00:54:07.920 250 to 300 of them uh
00:54:11.040 were on the computer every week at least
00:54:12.960 once or twice okay
00:54:14.240 and that happened because of parents
00:54:16.880 because of my helping get it started and
00:54:18.640 there were parents down here supervising
00:54:20.240 we don't have staff to do it
00:54:21.920 you know staff doesn't have extra time
00:54:23.280 we couldn't get a specialist
00:54:25.119 so it was done with parents
00:54:28.880 zinnia zinnia has anyone ever heard of
00:54:31.520 the word zinnia before
00:54:33.520 well you will during centers here's
00:54:35.920 another characteristic that we saw in
00:54:38.000 all of our principles highly effective
00:54:40.559 school leaders
00:54:41.599 support the personal and professional
00:54:44.000 growth of their teachers
00:54:46.799 so how much is that that you're showing
00:54:48.240 right there the new suncook school in
00:54:53.440 level maine
00:54:54.480 principal gary mcdonald is working with
00:54:56.559 children in one of the multi-age
00:54:58.400 classes it was the school's teachers who
00:55:01.359 first conceived the idea of
00:55:03.040 organizing multi-age classes
00:55:06.160 gary mcdonald supported their efforts
00:55:08.640 and his teachers know they can count on
00:55:10.480 him
00:55:11.040 whenever they need help i think the best
00:55:14.319 thing
00:55:14.960 is that his office door is always open
00:55:17.200 nothing's too small
00:55:18.240 for him and wow that's i think real
00:55:21.359 unusual i mean it can be just
00:55:22.799 something that you think is really petty
00:55:24.240 but he'll take time
00:55:26.160 and he has he has a good way of
00:55:27.920 questioning you when you have a new idea
00:55:30.319 of taking the other side but not it
00:55:33.040 doesn't make you defensive
00:55:34.480 he's a good devil's advocate but he is
00:55:37.040 he's great
00:55:38.960 or can they make it on their own does
00:55:40.400 mrs greenwood know they're coming
00:55:42.319 the best school leaders take the extra
00:55:44.480 step to support their teachers
00:55:46.720 euclid teacher geraldine allen remembers
00:55:49.040 a time when esther mcshane
00:55:50.960 made an extra effort for her
00:55:54.799 when she first came to the school i was
00:55:57.280 working on
00:55:59.200 a master's degree in education
00:56:02.559 she was always giving constantly giving
00:56:05.599 words of encouragement and
00:56:08.880 and breaks whenever possible i was
00:56:12.000 coming into the classroom
00:56:14.079 doing lessons with the students knowing
00:56:16.960 that i was doing things to
00:56:19.040 enhance my career
00:56:22.240 she just she shared she shared of
00:56:25.119 herself
00:56:26.400 and i'll never forget that strong school
00:56:30.160 leadership is one key to a highly
00:56:32.319 successful school
00:56:34.160 effective school leaders personally
00:56:36.160 select teachers
00:56:38.079 they take risks when necessary they
00:56:41.200 monitor their students
00:56:42.559 and staff they work hard and they
00:56:45.760 support their teachers
00:56:47.920 these principles tackle problems with
00:56:50.160 courage and skill
00:56:51.920 and though they may have different
00:56:53.280 styles and personalities
00:56:55.200 they all agree their job is to help
00:56:57.680 every child succeed
00:56:59.599 my philosophy is that i think these
00:57:02.319 children
00:57:03.200 deserve a wonderful education just by
00:57:06.400 showing
00:57:06.880 up and i intended to give it to each and
00:57:09.440 every one of them
00:57:10.720 and i look at my product in return
00:57:14.640 what kind of students do i produce
00:57:18.319 and if i produce high achieving happy
00:57:21.920 youngsters who have the stamina to go
00:57:24.640 out here and take advantage
00:57:26.160 of any opportunity that's offered to
00:57:28.480 them then i have done my job
