00:00:45.200 how well are all of your students
00:00:47.360 learning
00:00:49.520 are you constantly improving your
00:00:51.280 instruction
00:00:52.570 
00:00:53.920 highly successful schools ask themselves
00:00:56.640 tough questions like these
00:00:59.280 how do they find the answers
00:01:03.330 
00:01:24.479 monitoring student progress it can be as
00:01:27.040 casual as a principal visiting a
00:01:28.880 classroom or as formal as a standardized
00:01:31.920 test
00:01:33.040 at the highly successful schools we
00:01:34.880 visited monitoring was used to answer
00:01:37.200 important questions about the school
00:01:39.520 we're going to examine five of those
00:01:41.360 questions
00:01:42.930 
00:01:48.399 jimmy tells me he's in the top 98 of his
00:01:51.280 class
00:01:52.240 that sounds pretty good hey come back
00:01:55.119 here
00:01:56.290 
00:02:03.360 nancy ishinaga inherited a school with
00:02:05.600 severe problems
00:02:07.280 when she became principal of bennett q
00:02:09.280 elementary in englewood california she
00:02:11.520 asked herself
00:02:12.800 where are the students now
00:02:15.599 what is the level of academic
00:02:16.959 achievement in this school
00:02:19.040 and she quickly found out
00:02:21.280 when i first came here this was in 74
00:02:24.239 and the first test scores state test
00:02:26.000 scores came out our third graders were
00:02:27.440 reading at a three percentile which is
00:02:29.440 you really can't get lower than three
00:02:30.879 percentile and i approached the staff
00:02:33.040 and i said three percentile you know
00:02:34.800 what that means it means either the kids
00:02:36.319 are all
00:02:38.080 or something's not happening here
00:02:39.840 something's wrong with the program now
00:02:41.200 which is it and i think if it's only one
00:02:43.519 class nancy ishinaga and her staff used
00:02:45.840 the assessment data to take stock of
00:02:47.920 where their students were that's the
00:02:50.560 first step in any improvement effort and
00:02:53.360 it became clear to them that the
00:02:54.879 school's academic program was not
00:02:56.959 working
00:02:58.720 and of course they all had to admit
00:03:01.360 and they many of them already knew that
00:03:03.440 the program really wasn't doing what it
00:03:05.680 was supposed to do
00:03:07.200 so we really had very little problems we
00:03:09.840 all agreed that all kids can learn to
00:03:12.159 read me being a
00:03:14.400 skinnerian behaviorist i came up with
00:03:16.879 the fact that hey listen skinner talk
00:03:18.800 pigeons how to read
00:03:20.800 and if you could teach pigeons how to
00:03:22.640 read certainly you can teach every kid
00:03:25.200 in the school how to read
00:03:27.120 and that's where we started from
00:03:29.920 who can tell me the sound sound
00:03:33.120 oh
00:03:34.000 close
00:03:35.280 oh
00:03:36.400 my god let me see if oh you remember let
00:03:38.799 me see it first ow everybody what's the
00:03:40.640 sound
00:03:41.920 let me hear you say the sound kenneth oh
00:03:44.080 perfect mirror good what do you do if
00:03:46.640 you hurt yourself what do you probably
00:03:48.239 say ow
00:03:49.840 and that's exactly what he did let's
00:03:51.840 look at our return the ball without
00:03:53.840 kicking how's that you never know where
00:03:55.840 euclid principal esther mcshane will
00:03:57.680 turn up next
00:03:59.439 breaking up fights on the playground in
00:04:01.439 the classroom watching a new teacher
00:04:03.599 playing an educational game with
00:04:05.200 students or joining in song with a group
00:04:07.680 of fourth graders
00:04:09.200 she is constantly monitoring classrooms
00:04:11.599 and test scores
00:04:15.680 one way she uses that data is to create
00:04:18.079 standards of success for each child
00:04:21.358 academic success will be
00:04:24.320 that every child will every child will
00:04:28.320 show
00:04:30.320 gain
00:04:31.280 every year
00:04:32.800 so that a child that is on the 50
00:04:35.360 percentile
00:04:36.800 this year
00:04:38.160 we should be our goal should be
00:04:40.240 the 60 percentile that we should not be
00:04:43.199 satisfied
00:04:44.560 at any level
00:04:46.000 and i do have some children on the 11
00:04:49.840 percentile we that child
00:04:52.639 must get the support from this school to
00:04:55.440 grow up to
00:04:57.440 25 percentile 30 percentile because i
00:05:00.720 believe that every child is capable of
00:05:04.320 growing it may take
00:05:06.400 jose
00:05:08.240 three years to get to the 30th
00:05:10.479 percentile but my god he's going to get
00:05:13.440 there
00:05:15.840 lou yanu is another principal who uses
00:05:18.400 assessment data to create standards for
00:05:20.560 success
00:05:21.919 his school is thorncliff elementary
00:05:24.400 in edmonton alberta canada
00:05:27.120 here all students are tested at the
00:05:29.199 beginning and end of each school year by
00:05:32.160 identifying assessment needs of students
00:05:35.199 early in the school year we can tailor
00:05:37.360 our curriculum to meet the needs of
00:05:39.280 students
00:05:40.400 once we know where the students are when
00:05:42.880 they begin the school year we provide
00:05:46.240 the appropriate curriculum so that by
00:05:49.520 the end of the year on an assessment
00:05:52.000 profile we can demonstrate significant
00:05:55.199 growth
00:05:58.000 at the new suncook school in level maine
00:06:00.400 success is measured by more than just
00:06:02.560 test scores
00:06:04.160 so how much is that that you're showing
00:06:05.600 right there
00:06:06.639 principal gary mcdonald believes student
00:06:08.800 involvement in learning is just as
00:06:10.800 important
00:06:12.000 if you have children sitting in a small
00:06:14.160 group sitting by themselves and they're
00:06:16.639 actively engaged in learning
00:06:18.720 that to me means that they have an
00:06:20.080 investment in their learning
00:06:21.600 and see if they fit it if it does
00:06:24.080 circle the s
00:06:25.610 
00:06:27.840 what is not
00:06:30.530 
00:06:41.520 see how big he is compared to this one
00:06:43.360 because that one's curling up yeah this
00:06:45.039 one looks fat yeah they get fatter and
00:06:47.360 his his arm is still out it's not across
00:06:50.000 his chest yet
00:06:51.820 
00:06:57.280 to make sure her students master the
00:06:59.199 school's key learning objectives nancy
00:07:01.759 ishinaga and her staff have created a
00:07:03.840 rigorous curriculum
00:07:05.520 and they monitor student progress to see
00:07:07.759 if it's working
00:07:09.280 in other words we have a very
00:07:10.479 well-defined curriculum
00:07:12.880 and
00:07:13.759 i monitor
00:07:15.599 what happens in the classrooms by
00:07:18.639 periodic tests which the teachers all
00:07:21.039 give and every teacher in every grade
00:07:22.479 level gives the same tests
00:07:24.880 they turn in the results to me
00:07:27.599 and we go over them together to see
00:07:29.919 where strengths and weaknesses might be
00:07:32.560 where changes in the tests or changes in
00:07:35.039 the curriculum need to be made
00:07:38.000 i think there's too many papers here and
00:07:40.080 too many things to look at
00:07:42.479 could you guys kind of take a look at
00:07:43.840 them and come up with something that's
00:07:45.039 more usable for you guys could we even
00:07:47.199 give it instead of one three or four
00:07:48.879 could we give it a content score and a
00:07:50.319 mechanic score because they're they're
00:07:53.199 they they have something to do with one
00:07:54.639 another but
00:07:56.000 they're two different
00:07:57.199 things it's hard to uh consolidate them
00:07:59.599 right yeah that might be easier that
00:08:01.520 would be easier giving them two separate
00:08:03.199 scores yeah because if the content is
00:08:05.440 there you can focus in on the mechanics
00:08:07.840 and change those
00:08:09.199 yeah and that way you really went
00:08:12.319 well what do i need to work on i need to
00:08:13.840 work on mechanics or do i need to work
00:08:15.280 on
00:08:16.000 whether or not they can develop ideas
00:08:18.240 so you think the content it doesn't mean
00:08:20.639 that we control everything it means that
00:08:23.199 within a certain parameter the teachers
00:08:25.520 have all the freedom they want so if you
00:08:27.520 go into every class every teacher
00:08:29.919 teaches differently and different things
00:08:31.759 go on however
00:08:33.839 the basic framework is fair so that
00:08:36.640 everybody learns what they need to learn
00:08:41.200 what does this activity look like to you
00:08:43.919 some people call it chaos but new
00:08:46.560 suncook principal gary mcdonald calls it
00:08:49.200 active learning
00:08:50.560 well i think from the casual observer
00:08:52.640 certainly you begin to question what was
00:08:55.120 happening there's kids all over the
00:08:56.560 place
00:08:58.240 you know there's a lot of noise a lot of
00:08:59.839 interaction i think when you get
00:09:02.320 more involved in sitting down and being
00:09:05.440 with the kids and watching them interact
00:09:07.440 with the different centers then you find
00:09:09.360 that there is a tremendous amount of
00:09:11.360 learning going on
00:09:14.240 these students seem involved in their
00:09:16.080 lessons
00:09:17.120 but can teachers really monitor and
00:09:19.279 assess the learning going on here
00:09:21.680 there's a tremendous amount of
00:09:23.920 assessment that goes on within a day
00:09:27.360 and within the center time the teacher
00:09:29.600 is interacting with the children
00:09:30.800 individually they're looking at each of
00:09:32.720 the centers and creating
00:09:35.839 observation
00:09:37.120 a real assessment of where each of the
00:09:38.800 children are at as they move through
00:09:40.320 their center time and that's the part
00:09:42.240 that we begin to talk about as staff as
00:09:44.800 to what is the appropriateness of the
00:09:47.279 activity and it comes back to the
00:09:48.800 question we ask often during the day is
00:09:50.880 what are we doing and why are we doing
00:09:52.320 it
00:09:53.730 
00:10:01.839 new plants and trees sprout on rotting
00:10:04.160 logs it can take 300 years the highly
00:10:07.040 successful schools we visited were
00:10:08.720 determined to create success for every
00:10:10.959 child not just the top students
00:10:13.600 at alki pat sander uses classroom
00:10:16.079 monitoring and testing to make sure no
00:10:18.399 students fall through the cracks oh well
00:10:20.320 we'll have to get i'll give it a copy to
00:10:21.839 you i have it on my bulletin board from
00:10:23.200 my individual perspective as a principal
00:10:25.360 i want to know where the children are
00:10:27.440 i try and get into the classrooms every
00:10:29.120 day and monitor what's going on in there
00:10:31.440 good writing one way pat sander uses the
00:10:34.320 data she collects is to organize
00:10:36.399 students into learning groups
00:10:38.560 groups that will challenge them to do
00:10:40.480 their best
00:10:41.760 we move the children as they need to be
00:10:43.519 moved
00:10:44.640 through the frequent monitoring if we
00:10:46.240 start to assess that a child's taking a
00:10:47.920 growth spurt in education then we'll
00:10:50.399 move them to a group that's more
00:10:52.320 appropriate to them if we find out that
00:10:54.000 maybe they've slowed down a little bit
00:10:55.519 and the group that they're with
00:10:57.200 is moving at a faster pace
00:10:59.440 then we'll move the child again
00:11:01.839 in the first semester of the school year
00:11:03.760 the first 90 days we moved approximately
00:11:06.399 10 to 15 percent of the children
00:11:08.800 so that so it's not a tracking system
00:11:11.120 once they're put into a group but we
00:11:13.120 monitor that and watch where they're
00:11:14.640 going for the last site council
00:11:16.800 has a site council sort of like a board
00:11:18.800 of directors that helps run the school
00:11:21.600 four parents of al-kai students are on
00:11:23.600 the council and they are closely
00:11:25.600 involved in the details of student
00:11:27.519 monitoring at their school
00:11:29.200 moving right along
00:11:33.440 alki school has a diverse student body
00:11:36.480 the site council wants to be sure there
00:11:38.480 is no achievement gap for minority
00:11:40.480 students
00:11:41.360 so one of the things we're doing in this
00:11:42.640 you know in this group
00:11:44.640 of parents and and teachers is looking
00:11:46.720 at test scores how the test scores are
00:11:48.480 minority kids is the difference between
00:11:50.560 them increasing or decreasing and also
00:11:52.639 but look at for black children
00:11:54.480 look at the
00:11:55.760 the increase in the percentage of kids
00:11:57.680 that are in the top three
00:11:59.680 or in the middle within the middle it
00:12:01.760 went from you know 65 up to 90 percent
00:12:05.519 okay so in terms of that part of the
00:12:06.800 belt we said hey we're doing okay here
00:12:08.320 but this means that they were in the top
00:12:09.839 so all these things that we're doing at
00:12:11.200 this school
00:12:12.959 are they making a difference for kids
00:12:17.360 what's happening do you think back at
00:12:19.040 new sun cook school teacher linda
00:12:21.120 deshane is also determined to see
00:12:23.279 success for every child
00:12:30.639 her learning centers work because she
00:12:32.800 carefully monitors and knows each
00:12:35.200 student
00:12:38.000 children are in control of their choices
00:12:40.959 but the teacher is
00:12:43.200 responsible for finding out the needs of
00:12:45.120 the kids and giving them choices within
00:12:48.880 a range of activities and when you have
00:12:51.279 children long enough you can almost tell
00:12:53.040 when a child is choosing something
00:12:54.639 because it's easy
00:12:56.240 or because it's
00:12:58.160 um he'll get done quickly
00:13:00.880 or if he's choosing it because it's a
00:13:02.399 challenge
00:13:04.480 it's been successful for us i mean we
00:13:06.399 feel comfortable with it
00:13:15.760 i said your son doesn't seem to listen
00:13:19.040 very well
00:13:20.660 
00:13:25.440 and now you got the right answer now
00:13:26.959 let's see what you can do here
00:13:28.720 same thing here this is you have to bar
00:13:30.959 from here
00:13:32.160 to make it into a ten right
00:13:34.639 so what does this become at bennett q
00:13:36.959 school nancy ishinaga personally tests
00:13:39.519 the academic skills of each new student
00:13:42.720 she uses this assessment to get parents
00:13:45.040 involved in the child's
00:13:47.839 kids have already had fractions because
00:13:50.079 we do that in the first half of the year
00:13:52.000 in the fourth grade so my suggestion to
00:13:54.560 you is is to go to drugstore and look
00:13:57.920 for workbooks on simple fraction
00:14:00.399 and help her with that oh i know that
00:14:02.399 good objections
00:14:04.240 well that's good and it would help
00:14:06.480 because your son is in exactly the same
00:14:08.480 boat of course i have to do a lot of
00:14:10.399 counseling with the parents to make them
00:14:12.160 understand why and generally they
00:14:14.480 understand parents understand
00:14:17.199 kids have to attain certain skill levels
00:14:19.680 in fact many of them say
00:14:21.440 it's about time there's a school that
00:14:23.360 requires certain kinds of learning
00:14:24.880 before the kids are promoted in my other
00:14:26.639 school they just passed them on
00:14:29.120 so we don't do that
00:14:30.620 
00:14:42.480 those spiders mice and snakes live in
00:14:45.680 the forests at alki schools second and
00:14:48.639 third graders are grouped together at
00:14:50.720 what's called the primary level
00:14:53.040 fourth and fifth graders at the
00:14:54.480 intermediate level
00:14:56.240 this is part of the early childhood
00:14:58.160 model pioneered by louise mckinney
00:15:01.920 we say in our early childhood model
00:15:04.079 schools that if a child doesn't learn in
00:15:07.040 the way we teach him or her then it's
00:15:10.000 our responsibility to teach the way that
00:15:12.959 child learns
00:15:14.480 did anything happen to him after he
00:15:16.560 drank it no
00:15:18.880 yes so should we say
00:15:21.040 no freckles yet
00:15:22.959 did he sit and watch for them diane
00:15:25.440 tompkinson is a teacher at alki
00:15:28.000 she was looking for a way to improve her
00:15:30.000 students listening skills
00:15:32.079 a staff development expert from outside
00:15:34.320 the school showed her how to use an
00:15:36.320 instructional technique called story
00:15:38.240 painter
00:15:39.360 the children paint a picture to present
00:15:41.279 their vision of what a story is about
00:15:43.440 brain's moving
00:15:44.880 all right what do you want to say about
00:15:47.120 chapter three what do you think sabun
00:15:49.120 was illustrating here i think she was
00:15:51.839 illustrating
00:15:53.759 with the um
00:15:55.920 freckled truce
00:15:57.519 and he was mixing all the things up
00:15:59.839 together how do we want to say that the
00:16:02.160 main idea of what he was doing in
00:16:03.600 chapter three
00:16:05.360 andrew was
00:16:06.839 what was
00:16:11.199 what was he doing
00:16:13.040 was making
00:16:14.639 freckles juice for freckles he was
00:16:18.320 making
00:16:19.920 the more strategies and methods you have
00:16:22.240 the more children you reach
00:16:23.839 and the more interesting it becomes
00:16:25.920 and i think that's a key thing we're
00:16:27.199 finding nowadays is letting children
00:16:29.680 know there is more than one path to the
00:16:32.079 house
00:16:33.279 and they're all acceptable and
00:16:35.279 appropriate
00:16:36.399 and so that you have children taking
00:16:38.399 risks in learning
00:16:40.480 if you have a lot more staff taking risk
00:16:42.880 you see
00:16:43.920 there's so many things at work
00:16:46.160 and it's exciting to try out a wider
00:16:48.399 variety
00:16:51.040 at the highly successful schools we
00:16:52.800 visited the educators were constantly
00:16:55.120 monitoring student progress
00:16:57.680 monitoring helped them answer important
00:16:59.920 questions about the school such as how
00:17:02.160 do we define success and are any
00:17:04.959 students falling through the cracks
00:17:07.280 successful schools are in a constant
00:17:09.599 mode of self-improvement
00:17:11.679 they use monitoring to judge their
00:17:13.919 efforts
00:17:15.199 bottom line is student achievement and
00:17:18.319 we need to continue to work on we need
00:17:20.559 to focus in an area we need to grow in
00:17:23.439 that area
00:17:24.880 and as we see growth in that area we
00:17:27.119 need to identify another area
00:17:29.760 so that we can continue to build
00:17:32.480 on
00:17:33.679 techniques strategies
00:17:36.240 that can equal success for children
00:17:41.370 





00:18:03.160 
00:18:07.200 ineffective instructional strategies
00:18:09.760 number 17 a strategy for keeping
00:18:12.240 students on task
00:18:14.640 and that happened
00:18:16.559 during the reign of louis xiv
00:18:19.280 or was it louis the 15th
00:18:21.679 uh maybe it was louis the twelve you
00:18:23.440 want to see some real strategies
00:18:25.520 strategies that work
00:18:27.600 that's what this program is about
00:18:52.640 in highly successful schools the
00:18:54.720 educators work to develop effective
00:18:56.799 instructional strategies strategies that
00:18:59.360 produce results for their students in
00:19:01.679 their schools
00:19:03.280 in this program we'll examine five
00:19:05.200 strategies these schools use
00:19:08.210 
00:19:13.760 you can read this book so i'm going to
00:19:15.919 start by reading my book
00:19:18.559 successful schools create effective ways
00:19:20.880 to group students for instruction you
00:19:23.440 can either listen to me
00:19:33.360 at the van school in pittsburgh some
00:19:35.600 students are placed in a program called
00:19:37.520 els
00:19:38.960 early learning skills
00:19:40.880 els acts as a transition period between
00:19:43.360 kindergarten and first grade for
00:19:45.600 students who are not ready to advance
00:19:48.640 if you give them a year to learn the
00:19:50.640 importance of of language and work on
00:19:53.440 fine motor skills listening
00:19:56.240 attention span
00:19:58.240 and you also give them a year to build
00:19:59.679 up their confidence
00:20:01.280 they usually do very very well
00:20:06.150 
00:20:11.600 doris brevard is a strong supporter of
00:20:13.919 the early learning skills group she
00:20:16.000 calls it an ounce of prevention
00:20:18.320 we feel here if you can solve the
00:20:21.039 problems if you can get the children
00:20:22.799 help
00:20:23.679 at a very young age then that will
00:20:26.559 eliminate more serious problems when
00:20:29.039 they get older
00:20:30.400 that's why we stress
00:20:32.240 in the beginning
00:20:33.679 of the reading instruction that the
00:20:35.440 children master
00:20:37.200 whatever is being taught before they
00:20:39.120 move on
00:20:41.919 like other kids the els students can't
00:20:44.240 keep their hands off the school's
00:20:45.760 computers but they aren't playing games
00:20:48.559 they're using educational software that
00:20:50.559 nadine dega developed with her husband
00:20:53.440 well who do you think he's the boss of
00:20:56.320 the soldiers of the soldiers
00:20:59.679 wow do you think that's an important job
00:21:02.880 when you see something that the kids
00:21:04.240 really like and it's
00:21:06.080 it's valuable to them
00:21:07.919 and
00:21:09.039 something's working and getting through
00:21:10.640 to them it makes us all excited you know
00:21:12.480 and the extra work and the extra time
00:21:14.799 you don't mind doing it if you see
00:21:16.320 results and if you'd see these kids
00:21:18.480 faces whenever they're working at the
00:21:20.799 computer
00:21:22.720 it's just exciting
00:21:26.720 alki principal pat sander is also a
00:21:29.200 strong believer in grouping to support
00:21:31.440 instruction
00:21:33.760 she and her teachers monitor to find
00:21:35.679 each student's individual learning style
00:21:38.559 then they create instructional groupings
00:21:40.559 based on the children's needs
00:21:43.520 we move the children as they need to be
00:21:45.280 moved
00:21:46.400 through the frequent monitoring if we
00:21:47.919 start to assess that a child's taking a
00:21:49.679 growth spurt in education then we'll
00:21:52.159 move them to a group that's more
00:21:54.080 appropriate to them if we find out that
00:21:55.760 maybe they slowed down a little bit and
00:21:57.440 the group that they're with
00:21:58.960 is moving at a faster pace
00:22:01.200 then we'll move the child again
00:22:03.600 in the first semester of the school year
00:22:05.520 the first 90 days we moved approximately
00:22:08.159 10 to 15 percent of the children
00:22:10.559 so that so it's not a tracking system
00:22:12.880 once they're put into a group but we
00:22:14.880 monitor that and watch where they're
00:22:16.400 going
00:22:20.799 in some schools children in learning
00:22:22.720 groups are given labels you don't see
00:22:24.960 the labels but they exist and they may
00:22:26.960 stay with that child through every grade
00:22:32.799 that doesn't happen at alki
00:22:36.320 the basic philosophy goes back to all
00:22:38.080 children can succeed and when you place
00:22:39.919 labels on children expectations for
00:22:42.400 those children accompany those labels
00:22:44.559 and what we wanted was to make sure
00:22:46.960 that we weren't holding children back
00:22:48.720 because there was a label that was put
00:22:50.240 on them because of some bureaucratic
00:22:52.559 need to rationalize how monies was being
00:22:55.280 spammed
00:22:56.000 
00:23:06.640 spot
00:23:14.080 another important trait of successful
00:23:15.919 schools is appropriate pacing of
00:23:18.000 instruction
00:23:19.440 the emphasis here is on accelerating the
00:23:21.600 learning for all students even those who
00:23:23.840 are behind
00:23:25.200 without acceleration these students will
00:23:27.200 never catch up
00:23:30.320 now i can take that information
00:23:34.240 this is thorncliff school in edmonton
00:23:36.480 alberta canada
00:23:38.159 monica allman teaches a group of
00:23:39.760 students pulled from regular classes
00:23:41.679 because they were not doing grade level
00:23:43.360 work
00:23:44.640 her goal is clear bring every student up
00:23:47.600 to grade level in every subject
00:23:51.360 a really good example is in math
00:23:54.000 a number of my students my grade sixes
00:23:56.000 started off at a low grade three level
00:23:58.799 they could barely add subtract multiply
00:24:00.799 or divide
00:24:02.159 i told them that i had no intention of
00:24:03.840 keeping them in grade three if they
00:24:06.000 could prove to me they could master a
00:24:08.480 grade three
00:24:09.919 math curriculum so we worked at it and
00:24:12.720 they passed the grade three eighty
00:24:14.400 percent plus mastery so i put them in
00:24:17.120 grade four they thought this was
00:24:18.640 wonderful they did that they mastered
00:24:21.279 that i put them in grade five they
00:24:23.600 thought that was wonderful they mastered
00:24:25.600 the grade five and i put some of them
00:24:26.960 into grade six
00:24:28.640 they were then pestering me saying would
00:24:31.120 you put us into grade seven because a
00:24:33.039 number of my students should be in grade
00:24:34.559 seven one should be in grade eight and i
00:24:36.720 said yes i'm not here to hold you back
00:24:39.120 i'm here
00:24:40.400 to encourage you and make you the best
00:24:43.039 that you can be
00:24:44.320 and to bring you along as far as i can
00:24:47.600 you're doing all snakes so you're going
00:24:49.440 to have to tell you decided in these
00:24:51.679 classes the pacing of the instruction is
00:24:54.240 geared to help all children succeed by
00:24:56.720 emphasizing their strengths
00:25:01.360 good girl i want them to be aware that
00:25:03.440 they have weaknesses because i believe
00:25:05.360 everybody in um that is a learner has
00:25:08.640 some weaknesses somewhere but that
00:25:10.559 you'll use your strengths to overcome
00:25:12.640 those weaknesses and i'm very
00:25:15.760 very very demanding in that way i want
00:25:17.919 them to be the very best that they can
00:25:19.840 be
00:25:20.640 because they're our future
00:25:25.440 is that they can
00:25:27.600 john this is wonderful and who did this
00:25:30.080 one at alki elementary principal pat
00:25:32.640 sanders approach is to teach as though
00:25:34.720 every child were gifted at alki what
00:25:37.200 we've tried to do is
00:25:38.880 no longer remediate children but
00:25:40.960 accelerate them we believe that
00:25:43.919 the kinds of education that people have
00:25:46.480 supported for gifted children over the
00:25:48.799 last five or ten years are the kinds of
00:25:51.440 instructional approaches and the kinds
00:25:53.039 of education that all children should
00:25:54.880 have okay first we need to look
00:25:58.159 at the ones we need to look at the ones
00:26:00.000 and see if we need more ones right do we
00:26:02.000 need more ones this time matana yes yes
00:26:04.480 we need more ones
00:26:06.159 students who need extra help in some
00:26:07.840 areas will get it but they are still
00:26:10.159 held to the same standards as other
00:26:12.080 students
00:26:13.120 i require that teachers frequently
00:26:15.120 monitor student achievement and that
00:26:16.720 that student achievement comes to the
00:26:18.880 office
00:26:19.919 and that children
00:26:21.520 attain an 80 mastery in reading language
00:26:24.480 arts and mathematics objectives
00:26:26.799 it's not to say that on the first time
00:26:28.480 through that child may do that and it
00:26:30.000 will hold them in that place
00:26:32.000 but for five months later reteaching and
00:26:34.320 through some of the other activities i
00:26:36.480 would hope that retesting takes place
00:26:38.240 and that we can show that that child has
00:26:40.159 been able to in fact move up on the
00:26:42.400 mastery level
00:26:44.240 you think it's a dairy okay we'll come
00:26:45.919 back to you what do you think terry
00:26:47.679 nicole you think dairy and sophia
00:26:50.559 should they think dairy
00:26:52.960 meet another principal who sees a
00:26:54.720 potential for excellence in every
00:26:56.480 student beacon hill's gary tubbs
00:26:59.679 to find that potential he expects
00:27:01.520 teachers to use techniques that
00:27:03.120 accelerate learning
00:27:05.440 french fries because they both are
00:27:07.200 potatoes we have
00:27:09.279 taken our meals what we have found in
00:27:10.880 working with gifted educators or
00:27:12.799 educators who have worked with kids who
00:27:14.559 have been tested to be in the gifted
00:27:15.919 range so these techniques work with all
00:27:18.720 children there's a lot of research to
00:27:20.240 show you can actually raise intelligent
00:27:22.640 quotients by that kind of teaching so
00:27:25.600 all children are gifted if we just
00:27:27.279 haven't all necessarily discovered their
00:27:29.440 giftedness in all areas in the areas
00:27:31.200 that they excel
00:27:34.660 
00:27:37.039 mrs crenshaw i think this time your
00:27:39.520 students have gone a bit too far
00:27:42.890 
00:27:49.360 highly successful schools demand that
00:27:51.600 students be involved in their own
00:27:53.120 education
00:27:54.480 teachers at these schools use
00:27:55.919 instructional approaches that promote
00:27:57.760 active and enriched learning
00:28:01.679 at alki school second and third graders
00:28:04.399 are grouped together at what's called
00:28:05.919 the primary level
00:28:07.520 fourth and fifth graders at the
00:28:08.799 intermediate level
00:28:10.399 this is part of the early childhood
00:28:12.240 model pioneered by louise mckinney
00:28:15.279 we say in our early childhood model
00:28:17.440 schools that if a child doesn't learn in
00:28:20.480 the way we teach him or her then it's
00:28:23.440 our responsibility to teach the way that
00:28:26.399 child learns we also know that all of
00:28:29.120 our children are not analytics and that
00:28:32.000 analytics might do well working with
00:28:34.399 workbooks but the majority of the
00:28:36.320 children in our schools who do not learn
00:28:38.399 well
00:28:39.200 tend to be very global learners and so
00:28:42.000 they learn better when they have context
00:28:44.720 and meaning
00:28:47.520 turkey looks like turkey what's it feel
00:28:50.480 like to provide context and meaning for
00:28:52.880 their students
00:28:54.080 alki teachers diane tompkinson and lori
00:28:56.480 eba are about to lead a field trip to
00:28:58.640 the beach
00:28:59.760 the trip will complement the students
00:29:01.440 classroom lessons on sea life
00:29:03.760 the first step is getting the students
00:29:05.520 ready for the trip
00:29:06.960 do you think we need to know a lot more
00:29:08.559 to become beachologists yeah
00:29:11.120 okay do you think our trip to the beach
00:29:12.960 tomorrow is going to be something that
00:29:14.880 we're really going to learn a lot of
00:29:16.559 things on
00:29:18.399 do you think it's going to help us
00:29:20.960 the next day the students enjoy some
00:29:22.960 hands-on learning
00:29:24.480 the teachers hope this active experience
00:29:26.559 will motivate kids to learn more about
00:29:28.559 sea life
00:29:32.960 all of these areas underneath here are
00:29:35.840 three they're two feet and that's what
00:29:38.159 they attach
00:29:41.200 successful schools use a variety of
00:29:43.520 approaches and techniques
00:29:45.600 the same students who went to the beach
00:29:47.600 now put together their own books about
00:29:49.440 the field trip
00:29:50.880 they'll write poetry create math story
00:29:53.120 problems around sea life and do art
00:29:55.279 projects about the creatures they saw
00:29:59.440 it's a way to bring real life experience
00:30:02.880 so that the child
00:30:04.320 can then take that information back and
00:30:07.440 write about things they become totally
00:30:09.919 engrossed in what it is that they're
00:30:11.520 doing
00:30:12.480 and
00:30:13.440 the motivation is there the the feeling
00:30:15.919 that god we want to learn all we can
00:30:18.080 about it and
00:30:19.919 it just seems to create
00:30:23.200 a feeling in them that they
00:30:25.360 they can do it and they want to do it
00:30:27.360 and it has meaning to them and i think
00:30:29.440 that's the whole point of what we're
00:30:32.000 doing for kids is to create meaning for
00:30:34.320 them
00:30:42.399 teachers in successful schools are like
00:30:44.640 chameleons they adapt
00:30:46.880 they know how to customize instructional
00:30:48.720 materials and methods for their
00:30:50.399 classrooms
00:30:51.600 the driving force is student needs and
00:30:54.320 the adaptations help reinforce the
00:30:56.159 school's instructional mission
00:30:58.960 well i hope you're ready to have some
00:31:00.399 fun this afternoon
00:31:02.320 we're going to do an investigation that
00:31:04.240 deals with guess what
00:31:07.120 matter what is matter anybody know you
00:31:09.519 have an idea yes at the rice school in
00:31:12.240 dallas science teacher georgia beatty
00:31:14.799 has a terrific imagination
00:31:17.120 she uses common materials found at home
00:31:19.519 to create original and active lessons
00:31:21.840 for her students
00:31:24.960 okay now you need just some rolling you
00:31:26.480 don't need any more liquid
00:31:30.240 okay why don't you two guys get each
00:31:32.240 other if you're not willing to take in a
00:31:34.960 class after school or go the extra mile
00:31:38.320 or search for something beyond the
00:31:40.320 textbook put the textbook on the shelf
00:31:42.480 and do something creative then this
00:31:44.640 isn't the place for you we're not a
00:31:47.200 textbook oriented school where we just
00:31:49.440 simply you know start at chapter one and
00:31:51.519 proceed through chapter 14. we're very
00:31:54.080 different as long as the kids benefit
00:31:56.480 and that's the end product it's okay
00:31:58.720 just a little bit right there in the
00:32:00.080 center okay now you two partners like a
00:32:02.159 chameleon georgia beatty adapts to her
00:32:04.720 situation
00:32:06.000 when her students need something
00:32:07.360 different or when the school policy
00:32:09.039 changes she changes too
00:32:11.600 and even when you get to a point where
00:32:13.519 you think it's polished and
00:32:16.399 something changes and you then you wind
00:32:18.559 up starting all over every every time
00:32:20.240 they change change the textbooks or the
00:32:22.320 learner standards that we get from the
00:32:23.760 state i feel like a brand new teacher
00:32:25.120 again because i'm having to dig
00:32:27.120 and look and try to make something fit
00:32:29.679 to the particular needs of the kids
00:32:32.880 welcome to the new sun cook school in
00:32:34.880 level maine
00:32:36.159 give them half a chance and every
00:32:37.919 educator here will tell you about the
00:32:39.760 school's mission creating lifelong
00:32:42.240 independent learners
00:32:44.159 to realize that mission they customize
00:32:46.159 their curriculum and their teaching
00:32:47.919 methods
00:32:51.039 rhonda poliquin is a fourth grade
00:32:52.720 teacher at new suncook she calls herself
00:32:55.440 a guide a person who helps students
00:32:57.760 learn by teaching them how to find
00:32:59.600 information and solve problems
00:33:01.919 she has adapted her entire curriculum to
00:33:04.320 meet that goal
00:33:05.760 i think we've worked towards kids
00:33:07.200 becoming independent learners so that
00:33:09.120 you won't see as much
00:33:11.200 a teacher standing in front of the class
00:33:12.720 and lecturing to kids because we want
00:33:14.320 kids to find out how to get that
00:33:16.159 information themselves and if there's
00:33:17.919 something they want to find out about
00:33:19.600 giving them the tools and the skills
00:33:21.120 that they need to be able to find out
00:33:22.960 that information he's in the pupa stage
00:33:26.000 but he has
00:33:27.200 i think he might have just turned
00:33:29.279 because half of him is
00:33:31.600 sticking out and he has a little bit of
00:33:33.840 black right there okay can you write
00:33:36.159 that down in your journal really the
00:33:37.600 goal is to get kids to look at problems
00:33:39.600 in different ways
00:33:41.200 that you can look at it through an
00:33:42.480 example as a scientist or as a historian
00:33:45.919 and that using those perspectives that
00:33:47.600 will help you to solve problems which is
00:33:49.120 part of becoming an independent learner
00:33:56.600 introducing the chi square marching band
00:34:05.840 he's shaving away two-fifths
00:34:09.119 of the world's rain forest at successful
00:34:11.520 schools the educators are always
00:34:13.599 searching for new ways to steal time
00:34:15.679 from the school day for reinforcement in
00:34:17.918 language and math
00:34:19.679 for example
00:34:27.599 at rice school in dallas the students
00:34:29.918 begin every day by reading to the
00:34:31.839 accompaniment of classical music
00:34:34.960 oh my head heard says leslie
00:34:38.079 wow you saved my life said paul
00:34:41.839 at euclid principal esther mcshane often
00:34:44.560 reads to her students during the lunch
00:34:46.839 hour okay
00:34:48.879 and at beacon hill school students
00:34:50.879 practice their computer skills by
00:34:52.719 writing poetry
00:34:55.520 in the bushes it was a nice butterfly
00:34:59.440 and
00:35:03.520 welcome aboard
00:35:04.880 today's field trip at new suncook is
00:35:06.880 another good example of how schools
00:35:09.280 steal time for language and how teachers
00:35:11.920 at these schools integrate language into
00:35:14.160 other lessons
00:35:20.240 here's the story of a sorry caterpillar
00:35:23.599 by the name of danny miller
00:35:27.760 benny miller is a song about a
00:35:29.359 caterpillar who dreams of being a
00:35:31.119 butterfly
00:35:32.320 but after his transformation he is
00:35:34.240 captured and becomes part of a boy's
00:35:36.320 collection
00:35:37.599 now to think that benny miller had to
00:35:40.079 die
00:35:41.760 so poor benny died because some little
00:35:44.079 boy caught him for his collection
00:35:46.560 now would you like to draw some pictures
00:35:48.160 to go with that okay great
00:35:52.240 we've been studying entomology for quite
00:35:54.160 a few weeks now and one of the concepts
00:35:56.880 that we really want to get across to
00:35:58.640 children is
00:36:00.079 the idea that
00:36:02.720 nature
00:36:03.760 is very fragile and we need to protect
00:36:06.400 it this is a literacy activity and we
00:36:09.359 like to bring literacy experiences into
00:36:11.599 the field
00:36:12.800 and
00:36:13.760 it also might inspire some of their own
00:36:16.160 writing when they get back to the class
00:36:20.640 other students on this field trip will
00:36:22.480 search for insects in the field
00:36:25.359 and in the stream
00:36:30.480 after some exploring susan steller's
00:36:32.800 class will design their own insects
00:36:34.800 complete with camouflage
00:36:42.560 by combining entomology with language
00:36:44.720 and art the nissan cook teachers help
00:36:46.960 strengthen basic communication skills
00:36:49.440 plus it's just plain fun
00:36:53.359 i think they're having a wonderful time
00:36:55.760 i think they're learning a lot and
00:36:57.440 having fun doing it
00:36:59.290 
00:37:01.520 at the highly successful schools we
00:37:03.440 visited the educators develop
00:37:05.440 instructional strategies that work for
00:37:07.520 their students
00:37:08.880 they group for instruction
00:37:11.040 they carefully pace instruction to
00:37:12.800 accelerate students
00:37:14.560 they create active and enriched lessons
00:37:17.520 they customize instruction to their
00:37:19.200 students needs
00:37:20.640 and they steal time for language and
00:37:22.880 math
00:37:24.079 these strategies are designed to help
00:37:26.320 every child succeed
00:37:30.380 






00:37:54.140 
00:37:58.480 we
00:37:59.520 believe that it is our job to educate
00:38:02.000 the kids to make them literate
00:38:04.560 it's not the home's job it's our job
00:38:07.920 if the home helps it's fine but if they
00:38:10.640 don't help we still have to educate and
00:38:12.960 make the kids literate kids who come to
00:38:14.960 bennett too
00:38:16.480 if they're here for any length of time
00:38:18.079 you can be sure that they can read
00:38:20.640 they can write they can compute and they
00:38:23.359 can speak well because this is our job
00:38:26.320 and this is what we plan to do and this
00:38:28.560 is what we do
00:38:30.250 
00:38:52.640 seven plus two is nine so nine take away
00:38:56.160 two is
00:39:07.599 effective schools we visited we found
00:39:09.920 principals and teachers who worked
00:39:11.920 together toward a common goal high
00:39:14.320 levels of attainment for all students
00:39:17.359 at the euclid school in los angeles
00:39:19.760 principal esther mcshane and her staff
00:39:22.160 focus on student learning honoring the
00:39:25.040 hispanic cultural month we're only here
00:39:27.599 for one reason and that is to educate
00:39:30.000 children and i'm responsible for the
00:39:32.240 education of every single child that
00:39:34.880 enters this gate i they they have
00:39:37.520 entered my spare of life so i am
00:39:39.680 responsible for it and i need to provide
00:39:41.920 the climate
00:39:43.680 the environment where learning can take
00:39:46.160 place
00:39:47.200 group two
00:39:48.880 will use computers
00:39:51.040 and you will
00:39:52.640 recreate
00:39:54.839 stories i want my children to believe in
00:39:58.240 themselves
00:39:59.760 and to believe that they can accomplish
00:40:02.640 anything they choose to
00:40:05.680 and
00:40:06.480 i realize that my job is to teach them
00:40:09.359 strategies
00:40:10.640 for accomplishing these things
00:40:14.319 and we left the house on gardens
00:40:19.119 at the bennett q school just outside los
00:40:21.680 angeles principal nancy ichinaga has a
00:40:24.400 similar partnership with her faculty
00:40:28.560 a school should be a place where kids
00:40:31.040 come to learn
00:40:32.880 a school should be a place
00:40:35.440 where a kid succeeds and where kid is
00:40:38.480 valued
00:40:40.720 and we have a specific goal so when a
00:40:43.520 kid leaves us we want him to have
00:40:46.319 certain knowledge certain
00:40:49.440 skills we want him to be able to go to
00:40:52.079 the next step and be successful this
00:40:55.280 crowd
00:40:57.040 has
00:40:58.240 a great flower okay great which one you
00:41:01.920 get a good
00:41:03.119 principal
00:41:04.240 who knows what she's talking about and
00:41:06.480 knows curriculum and knows her people
00:41:08.960 then then anyone can do it and and not
00:41:12.000 no one should take excuses we don't have
00:41:13.920 excuses for why children can't learn
00:41:17.960 
00:41:21.839 first you have to get their attention
00:41:24.130 
00:41:32.319 when principles and teachers focus on
00:41:34.800 learning for all students the first
00:41:36.880 priority is maximizing the time
00:41:38.960 available for learning to take place
00:41:41.760 discipline is one important element in
00:41:44.000 providing an environment for learning
00:41:45.680 what's the month
00:41:47.200 you can tell me the name of this month
00:41:51.119 philip november excellent what letter
00:41:54.000 does the word at the van school in
00:41:55.839 pittsburgh principal doris brevard feels
00:41:58.560 strongly about her role the principal
00:42:01.119 must provide the atmosphere and then
00:42:03.920 it's the teacher's job to teach
00:42:06.960 but if that teacher can go into his or
00:42:09.680 her classroom and teach
00:42:11.839 35 minutes of the 40-minute period then
00:42:15.200 something will be accomplished
00:42:17.280 but the principal must see to it that
00:42:19.599 the discipline throughout the building
00:42:21.599 is such that the teacher can teach the
00:42:24.400 35 minutes
00:42:26.640 no so what did he have to use to look at
00:42:28.960 that picture cathy gallagher teaches
00:42:31.520 fourth grade at vann
00:42:33.440 i know that when i go in my room
00:42:36.079 i will have an atmosphere in which i can
00:42:38.000 teach
00:42:39.280 and i think one of the things i always
00:42:41.280 remember when i first came to van she
00:42:42.960 said to me you can teach whatever style
00:42:44.880 you like your style is your style
00:42:47.599 and as long as you're teaching and
00:42:49.040 children are learning
00:42:50.480 that's all i ask of you
00:42:52.800 and she also told me that when i go in
00:42:55.520 my room to teach i will have an
00:42:57.119 atmosphere in which i can teach
00:42:59.680 and if i don't have that atmosphere
00:43:02.319 then that's her job to provide it for me
00:43:04.240 and i have it's always been provided for
00:43:06.079 me
00:43:08.400 another way to maximize learning time is
00:43:10.800 to move swiftly from one class activity
00:43:13.359 to the next as in dana brooks class at
00:43:16.079 the rice school in dallas
00:43:18.160 make sure your pencils
00:43:19.680 are put either in the container on your
00:43:21.440 tables or on the floor i'll give you
00:43:23.280 about three seconds to get yourselves
00:43:24.880 together three
00:43:27.359 two
00:43:29.440 one
00:43:32.000 zero
00:43:34.480 okay if you will remember whether it's a
00:43:36.800 teacher-centered school such as the rice
00:43:38.880 school in dallas
00:43:40.400 or a more student-centered school such
00:43:42.640 as new sun cook in maine
00:43:46.319 right now it's time for you to clean up
00:43:47.760 your space and go to your meeting area
00:43:50.400 transitions take very little time if we
00:43:53.520 had to yell to them or say okay it's
00:43:56.400 time to clean up they wouldn't hear us
00:43:58.000 so by clapping a pattern it brings their
00:44:00.079 attention to what we're doing
00:44:02.079 and the hands on the head is
00:44:03.839 they can't be touching anything while
00:44:05.200 they're listening so they have a better
00:44:06.880 listening time when they when they have
00:44:08.720 a hands on their head
00:44:10.720 maximizing learning time also means that
00:44:13.440 every possible minute is devoted to
00:44:15.440 teaching and learning
00:44:17.440 at the euclid school in los angeles that
00:44:20.000 can even mean having the principal read
00:44:22.079 stories to the students at lunch
00:44:25.280 lastly reach down for him try to grab my
00:44:28.880 hand she said
00:44:31.280 for a principal like esther mcshane
00:44:33.440 maximizing learning is a high priority
00:44:36.720 effective use of time is one of the
00:44:38.640 things she looks for in the classroom
00:44:41.680 what i look for in a classroom is to see
00:44:44.880 time on task
00:44:47.119 why is it that the child is engaged in
00:44:49.680 that activity is that activity
00:44:53.119 challenging
00:44:54.560 does it raise another level of awareness
00:44:57.200 for a child
00:44:58.880 our children exchanging ideas with one
00:45:02.839 another a deer where does it look like a
00:45:05.520 deer point
00:45:07.220 
00:45:12.960 all i'm saying is that if you'd been a
00:45:14.720 little more proficient in math
00:45:16.800 this would have never happened
00:45:19.140 
00:45:21.480 blind hi which eye is it
00:45:25.599 put it down
00:45:31.280 at the van school in pittsburgh their
00:45:33.920 goal is for all students to master the
00:45:36.079 academic content
00:45:38.079 the curriculum is structured to help
00:45:40.000 students achieve that goal
00:45:42.400 we're going to do this step by step
00:45:44.400 we're going to get it right
00:45:46.560 okay the primary level is the foundation
00:45:49.920 for the educational system if they start
00:45:52.560 out and they're passed through and they
00:45:54.160 don't have the basics for reading they
00:45:56.079 don't have the basics for math they
00:45:58.160 never get it it has to be achieved in
00:46:00.640 the primary level and we firmly believe
00:46:03.200 that and we work for it
00:46:05.680 great job i knew you could do it very
00:46:08.480 good
00:46:12.079 van principal doris brevard has the same
00:46:14.720 conviction
00:46:16.240 we feel here if you can solve the
00:46:19.040 problems if you can get the children
00:46:20.720 help
00:46:21.599 at a very young age then that will
00:46:24.480 eliminate the more serious problems when
00:46:26.960 they get older that's why we stress
00:46:30.160 in the beginning
00:46:31.599 of the reading instruction that the
00:46:33.359 children master
00:46:35.119 whatever is being taught before they
00:46:37.119 move on
00:46:39.200 it's steam that's right
00:46:45.119 we know how to direct our kids to make
00:46:46.880 it work we know the problem
00:46:48.480 at the bennett q school in los angeles
00:46:51.200 nancy ichinaga also stresses the value
00:46:53.839 of a structured sequenced curriculum
00:46:57.680 we have worked out a system where
00:47:01.520 everybody
00:47:02.720 goes through everybody is taught
00:47:04.800 specific things that make them
00:47:06.400 successful student and it's what every
00:47:09.760 teacher does
00:47:12.640 that's a perfect explanation so would
00:47:14.560 you read that statement eleanor for us
00:47:18.160 howard rothenberg teaches math at
00:47:20.160 bennett q or you should have common
00:47:22.079 denominators if you don't have the
00:47:23.839 foundations from first second third
00:47:25.440 grade you can't begin fourth grade where
00:47:27.520 you need to start and you have to go
00:47:29.040 back and remediate and you're losing
00:47:30.400 time and the children and that's what
00:47:31.680 happens in most inner city schools the
00:47:33.119 children are
00:47:34.400 years behind
00:47:35.680 because every year has to go back and
00:47:36.960 repeat what they did not learn
00:47:38.079 previously well we do not have that
00:47:39.520 problem here for the most part
00:47:41.359 so that they can see if they've
00:47:42.400 forgotten that they multiplied everybody
00:47:44.319 would you multiply by here
00:47:46.800 three to get 9 12. that's just what i
00:47:48.880 meant we have a very structured
00:47:50.240 curriculum at each grade level and every
00:47:52.240 teacher knows what he or she is
00:47:53.599 responsible to teach
00:47:55.280 so that the following years teacher can
00:47:56.640 take up at that spot and the kids are
00:47:58.400 pretty much at grade level and you're
00:48:00.160 able to start there and and work from
00:48:01.839 that point one of the very important
00:48:04.000 things about our school is that our kids
00:48:05.760 are held accountable for their learning
00:48:08.400 in other words we have expectations by
00:48:10.720 grade level for every kid and the kids
00:48:13.440 of the parents know from the very very
00:48:15.440 beginning that if they are in
00:48:17.359 kindergarten
00:48:18.720 these are the things they have to master
00:48:20.960 before the year is over and if they
00:48:23.040 don't they probably will not go on to
00:48:25.040 the next grade
00:48:26.559 parents understand
00:48:28.319 kids have to attain certain skill levels
00:48:30.960 that's not new in fact many of them say
00:48:34.079 it's about time there's a school that
00:48:35.920 requires certain kinds of learning
00:48:37.520 before the kids are promoted in my other
00:48:39.280 school they just passed them on
00:48:41.680 so we don't do that
00:48:45.359 at the alki school in seattle the
00:48:47.680 curriculum is more flexible
00:48:50.800 principal pat sander is just as
00:48:52.800 concerned about success for all students
00:48:55.520 but she has her own approach for
00:48:57.040 reaching that goal
00:48:58.800 we believe that the kinds of education
00:49:01.040 that people have supported for gifted
00:49:03.599 children over the last five or ten years
00:49:06.640 are the kinds of instructional
00:49:07.920 approaches and the kinds of education
00:49:09.599 that all children should have
00:49:11.839 so that
00:49:12.960 instead of saying you have to crawl
00:49:15.920 before you walk some children may in
00:49:18.160 fact walk and go back and learn to crawl
00:49:20.079 later
00:49:21.280 now we're going to be doing quite a few
00:49:23.520 things over this next several weeks to
00:49:26.559 celebrate and continue our
00:49:29.200 study of the rain forest
00:49:31.119 what i'd like you to do now is take your
00:49:32.720 spelling paper
00:49:34.079 because our spelling words this week
00:49:36.800 are rain forest words
00:49:39.200 fred pruitt teaches at alki
00:49:41.920 his class is studying the rain forest in
00:49:44.319 science
00:49:45.520 that content is also used to teach
00:49:48.000 spelling and build vocabulary all right
00:49:50.640 the word to teach punctuation
00:49:53.440 or the a
00:49:55.200 and also math
00:49:56.720 he's shading away
00:49:58.400 two-fifths
00:50:00.079 of the world's rain forest
00:50:03.119 whether a school uses a highly
00:50:04.880 structured sequenced curriculum or one
00:50:07.440 that is more flexible in highly
00:50:09.599 effective schools the emphasis is always
00:50:12.240 on mastering academic content
00:50:15.280 i have a job to do i'm going to be with
00:50:17.040 these children for one year and my goal
00:50:19.599 is to
00:50:20.640 help them want to learn and to learn as
00:50:23.119 much as they can in that one year
00:50:24.720 because they're not going to get that
00:50:26.319 chance again
00:50:33.599 it's a good thing this school provides a
00:50:35.200 lot of individual instruction
00:50:37.359 at least i'm falling behind at my own
00:50:39.040 pace
00:50:41.680 to make sure students are learning
00:50:43.599 highly effective schools monitor their
00:50:45.760 progress and provide special help when
00:50:48.160 necessary
00:50:51.119 at the thorncliffe school in edmonton
00:50:53.280 alberta canada principal lou yanu has
00:50:56.240 goals for each student
00:50:58.480 we have
00:50:59.680 identified for each individual a
00:51:02.480 learning profile so that over the course
00:51:05.839 of the time that the student is in the
00:51:08.160 school whether it be one year or seven
00:51:10.720 years kindergarten through grade seven
00:51:12.960 we would be able to track their progress
00:51:15.680 the goal is that every child
00:51:18.640 is capable of
00:51:20.480 high levels of success
00:51:22.720 and that what we wish to see for each
00:51:25.359 individual child on a year-to-year basis
00:51:28.079 is growth from september through june
00:51:31.280 and that that growth profile continue to
00:51:33.920 raise as they continue on
00:51:36.559 at our school a story that you're
00:51:38.559 thinking of another one of our goal
00:51:40.720 statements and belief statements is that
00:51:43.119 if children can't learn the way we teach
00:51:45.440 then we must teach the way they learn
00:51:48.160 if a child in the in the classroom is
00:51:50.720 having difficulty learning the teachers
00:51:53.119 have committed themselves to working
00:51:55.200 with that child
00:51:59.040 okay now sometimes we're in places where
00:52:00.880 we sit really close to each other and
00:52:03.119 what happens you had mentioned to me
00:52:05.040 earlier jared something that you want to
00:52:06.480 do when you feel kind of squished
00:52:09.040 what do you want to do
00:52:10.960 you want to what
00:52:12.720 push them away and get them out of the
00:52:14.640 way because you feel squished and then
00:52:16.960 what happens chris when somebody pushes
00:52:18.640 you what do you want to do
00:52:20.640 push them back push them back and then
00:52:22.960 what happens
00:52:28.319 and then sure enough you end up in a
00:52:30.000 fight there's no doubt about it but
00:52:32.319 we're going to practice some skills
00:52:33.760 today so that hopefully you will
00:52:36.240 remember not to want to go get out of
00:52:38.640 here okay
00:52:40.160 this is called ignoring distractions at
00:52:42.559 thorncliffe helping students learn can
00:52:44.640 mean teaching behavioral skills in
00:52:46.480 classes such as this one taught by pat
00:52:48.880 castoros
00:52:50.079 the purpose in having the kids come into
00:52:51.680 the skills program is that the teachers
00:52:53.680 have
00:52:55.119 checklisted certain behaviors in the
00:52:56.960 classroom that they notice that they're
00:52:58.400 lacking in those particular skills and
00:53:00.400 so need practice in those areas
00:53:02.880 go for it
00:53:05.040 yes nina
00:53:07.280 you certainly can sharpen your pencil if
00:53:09.200 you're not able to behave and you're
00:53:12.079 distracting others and you're distracted
00:53:14.319 yourself then you're really not picking
00:53:16.640 up the academic things that the teachers
00:53:18.240 are offering
00:53:19.359 it fits into the basic philosophy of the
00:53:21.520 whole school that learning is important
00:53:23.599 that practice is important to be the
00:53:25.520 best that you can be
00:53:27.040 if you're lacking some skills we'll
00:53:28.480 offer them to you so you can better your
00:53:30.000 life
00:53:33.359 at alki school in seattle pat sander
00:53:36.400 uses a mainstream approach to ensure
00:53:38.800 student success
00:53:40.480 one of her first moves as principal was
00:53:42.400 to get the non-english students into
00:53:44.240 regular classrooms as quickly as
00:53:45.920 possible
00:53:47.200 we've tried to do an immersion technique
00:53:49.599 and
00:53:50.480 instead of having those children pulled
00:53:52.480 out where they're in a room with other
00:53:54.720 children that are speaking the
00:53:56.000 conglomerations of languages and
00:53:57.760 dialects
00:53:59.040 we have looked at instructional
00:54:01.440 placements that are appropriate to them
00:54:03.599 and mainstream them in with the rest of
00:54:05.440 the children
00:54:06.640 and so consequently the english language
00:54:08.640 then
00:54:09.440 seems to take off much more quickly with
00:54:11.920 those children
00:54:16.480 what you can do is type in the list of
00:54:18.160 words on the crossword magic the same
00:54:20.480 approach applies to children with
00:54:22.079 learning disabilities or physical
00:54:23.839 handicaps
00:54:25.280 they spend a small part of the day with
00:54:27.440 special ed teacher to vanvic
00:54:30.319 or in individual instruction
00:54:32.770 
00:54:35.040 but the majority of their time is spent
00:54:37.359 in regular classrooms
00:54:39.599 they need to be in class they will learn
00:54:41.839 more by learning from their peers and
00:54:44.160 from their teachers and by learning how
00:54:46.319 to use the textbooks and how to listen
00:54:49.040 and how to take notes those are all more
00:54:50.720 useful skills for them as they go on in
00:54:52.960 school than
00:54:54.640 pulling them out and working one-on-one
00:54:58.240 the basic philosophy goes back to all
00:54:59.920 children can succeed and what we wanted
00:55:02.319 was to make sure
00:55:03.760 that we weren't holding children back
00:55:05.599 because there was a label that was put
00:55:07.040 on them because of some bureaucratic
00:55:09.440 need to
00:55:10.720 to
00:55:12.079 rationalize how monies was being spent
00:55:15.920 it takes a combination of factors to
00:55:18.079 make a successful school but an emphasis
00:55:20.960 on essential learning skills is one of
00:55:23.200 the most important
00:55:25.040 the schools in this program maximize the
00:55:27.520 time available for learning
00:55:29.680 they design a curriculum that stresses
00:55:31.680 mastery of academic content and they
00:55:34.720 provide support for students who are not
00:55:37.280 succeeding
00:55:38.720 i think that a child who doesn't feel
00:55:41.520 good about himself
00:55:43.200 can not feel good about the world
00:55:46.400 so we try to make every one of our kids
00:55:49.119 successful at least academically so
00:55:52.400 whatever may be wrong with another part
00:55:54.400 of his life at least this part is good
00:55:57.359 and we hope that for many of them this
00:55:59.359 will carry them through and i think it
00:56:01.839 will
00:56:03.280 i really do believe
00:56:11.010 
00:56:16.240 i
