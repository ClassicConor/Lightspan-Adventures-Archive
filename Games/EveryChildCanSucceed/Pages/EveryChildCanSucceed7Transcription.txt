00:29:40.720 does our team work
00:29:42.399 do we focus on success
00:29:44.480 are we becoming the best that we can be
00:29:46.880 what is the key to success
00:29:49.720 
00:29:51.679 and the reason why we are doing all of
00:29:53.520 this is because we are
00:29:58.480 the students at thorncliffe community
00:30:00.399 school say they're building their future
00:30:02.880 it's a far cry from the past when
00:30:05.360 thorncliff was one of the most dangerous
00:30:07.360 schools in edmonton alberta kids were
00:30:09.600 just out of control at school there was
00:30:11.440 no consequence that would fit their
00:30:13.440 their action
00:30:14.960 enter lou yanu who was named principal
00:30:17.760 four years ago
00:30:19.679 he brought in some new teachers
00:30:21.760 an entirely new attitude
00:30:24.640 and a new approach
00:30:27.039 this was to be a student-centered school
00:30:30.240 in a student-centered school the belief
00:30:33.279 the generic belief is that every child
00:30:36.640 can succeed
00:30:39.039 and they are succeeding
00:30:41.919 discipline problems are down
00:30:44.159 academic achievement is up
00:30:46.159 and school spirit is off the
00:30:48.840 charts thorncliffe community school
00:30:52.240 has taken off
00:30:56.100 
00:30:57.960 
00:31:16.780 
00:31:17.350 
00:31:20.320 it's a big day at thorncliffe
00:31:23.600 this is a showdown between two floor
00:31:25.600 hockey teams
00:31:27.279 the students against the teachers
00:31:30.640 at stake the kuba saw cup
00:31:35.360 as usual the head cheerleader is
00:31:37.440 thorncliff principal lou yanu
00:31:42.960 right now the 300 thorncliff students
00:31:45.440 are finishing a series of intensive
00:31:47.519 assessment exams
00:31:49.600 which is exactly why this game is being
00:31:52.159 played
00:31:53.600 if we can introduce
00:31:55.679 something that children can enjoy
00:31:58.399 and loosen up in regards to and have a
00:32:00.480 little bit of fun with
00:32:02.159 then it just makes coming to school and
00:32:04.640 going through the assessment period just
00:32:06.880 a little easier for them and in the
00:32:09.360 gymnasium during the time of the cup you
00:32:12.080 can just
00:32:13.200 see it on the faces of the students how
00:32:15.279 much they're enjoying this
00:32:17.840 the students are enjoying it
00:32:20.159 so are the teachers
00:32:21.760 especially when they score the first
00:32:23.760 goal
00:32:25.519 it's the teachers one to nothing more
00:32:28.080 about the game later
00:32:31.200 thorncliffe is a school that's
00:32:32.640 undergoing a radical transformation
00:32:35.760 one that began when lu yanu arrived four
00:32:38.240 years ago what are you doing to mentally
00:32:40.480 prepare them
00:32:41.679 at the time thorncliff was one of the
00:32:44.000 worst schools in edmonton
00:32:46.720 the school sits on the west side of the
00:32:48.640 city
00:32:49.600 in the shadow of the enormous west
00:32:51.440 edmonton mall
00:32:53.440 by u.s standards the surrounding
00:32:55.440 neighborhood might not seem poverty
00:32:57.360 ridden
00:32:58.720 but three-quarters of thorncliffe
00:33:00.399 students are considered low-income
00:33:02.960 and nearly half come from single-parent
00:33:05.200 families
00:33:07.200 this is a troubled neighborhood with one
00:33:09.200 of the highest crime rates in edmonton
00:33:11.760 and many of those troubles were carried
00:33:13.679 over into thorncliff
00:33:15.600 it was a school that in many ways was
00:33:18.480 very dysfunctional teachers were
00:33:21.360 suspending students from the classroom
00:33:25.120 to the tune of over
00:33:26.799 300 a month
00:33:29.039 out of the classroom for being
00:33:30.880 disruptive and out of control
00:33:33.600 while some students were unruly
00:33:36.000 many others were frightened james ross
00:33:39.120 is a sixth grader at thorncliffe
00:33:41.360 he remembers how things were
00:33:43.600 before on the playgrounds there's a lot
00:33:45.440 of violence and fighting all the time
00:33:48.799 and you couldn't go outside without
00:33:50.399 being afraid lou yano's first priority
00:33:53.600 was to eliminate the fear
00:33:56.080 he did away with corporal punishment but
00:33:58.640 set up strict rules for behavior
00:34:02.480 any student breaking those rules is
00:34:04.399 disciplined quickly and fairly you told
00:34:07.039 the boy not to touch your ball what
00:34:08.719 should you have done then besides
00:34:10.239 kicking him
00:34:12.480 that's right now when you told michael
00:34:15.679 not to touch your ball how did you tell
00:34:17.280 them that
00:34:18.239 ted davis presides over daily detention
00:34:21.280 children who have broken a rule spend
00:34:22.960 their recess time here okay
00:34:25.679 you hit somebody
00:34:26.960 you're going to have a recess attention
00:34:28.480 you hit somebody in the
00:34:29.918 in the uh outside the school there's
00:34:31.520 going to be a consequence for that if
00:34:32.719 you hit somebody when you're older and
00:34:34.879 it's in the
00:34:36.000 in a mall or in a in a dark shopping
00:34:38.399 center parking lot there's going to be a
00:34:40.000 consequence for that action and that's
00:34:41.599 what we're trying to get these kids to
00:34:42.639 realize there's a there's a consequence
00:34:44.159 for all their actions good morning boys
00:34:46.159 and girls
00:34:50.480 discipline is also maintained by
00:34:52.560 positive reinforcement
00:34:54.879 this assembly is to award monthly
00:34:57.040 diamond of distinction certificates to
00:34:59.200 students who exhibit exemplary behavior
00:35:02.560 any student who earns a certificate is
00:35:04.560 eligible for a drawing to be held the
00:35:06.560 last day of school
00:35:08.160 the grand prize for the diamond of
00:35:10.400 distinction award will be a brand new 18
00:35:14.400 speed bicycle any idea why you're here
00:35:18.079 um
00:35:19.200 i don't
00:35:20.400 another distinction at thorncliffe is to
00:35:22.320 be called to the principal's office
00:35:24.960 at this school it usually means you did
00:35:27.440 something right
00:35:28.800 for the most part mitch you've made a
00:35:30.800 lot of changes here at the school you
00:35:32.960 put in a lot of great effort and that's
00:35:35.280 why you're here this afternoon
00:35:37.920 i received this let me tell you what a
00:35:39.839 celebration it is for the students when
00:35:42.079 they come down to the office i am very
00:35:45.839 impressed and we have an opportunity to
00:35:49.359 to share the good news with one another
00:35:51.680 and then in each and every case i take
00:35:54.000 it upon myself in the presence of the
00:35:56.079 student to inform the parent or guardian
00:35:59.839 of that child whether they be at home or
00:36:02.720 or at work
00:36:04.000 and it is just a wonderful celebration
00:36:06.880 well that's just great
00:36:09.119 he just loves that school so much and
00:36:11.040 he's done so well since uh he's been
00:36:13.760 going there if it weren't for the
00:36:15.520 teachers and yourself
00:36:17.520 he would not do as well as he does
00:36:20.400 lou yanu also went about transforming
00:36:22.640 the entire school atmosphere
00:36:25.359 thorncliff was to be a place where all
00:36:27.599 children could succeed as part of our
00:36:29.760 belief statement
00:36:31.040 we believe that all students have three
00:36:33.839 generic needs one a need for competency
00:36:37.119 and achievement two a need for structure
00:36:39.359 safety control and discipline and three
00:36:42.000 a need for positive personalized
00:36:43.760 interaction between peers and adults
00:36:46.240 as a staff then if we collectively
00:36:48.560 believe this
00:36:49.839 at our staff meetings we make decisions
00:36:52.480 as to programs activities and events
00:36:55.359 that match that
00:36:57.599 oh wonderful you're doing great can you
00:37:00.079 feel it pulling positive interaction
00:37:02.160 between children and adults
00:37:04.320 it's evident in the classroom and on the
00:37:06.480 playground
00:37:08.240 lujanu does whatever it takes to make
00:37:10.640 thorncliff as enjoyable as possible
00:37:13.839 his enthusiasm is obvious
00:37:16.160 it's also highly contagious
00:37:19.280 but discipline and an inviting
00:37:21.119 atmosphere our only means to an end
00:37:23.839 the primary mission of thorncliffe is
00:37:26.000 education
00:37:28.480 if children enjoy coming to school
00:37:30.240 there's no question
00:37:31.680 they will learn
00:37:33.119 if children do not enjoy coming to
00:37:35.280 school and in fact hate being in class
00:37:39.520 regardless of how tight your curriculum
00:37:41.839 is they will learn less than they are
00:37:44.400 capable of so the teaching learning
00:37:47.280 process must be interesting it also must
00:37:50.480 be inviting
00:37:51.920 and fun
00:37:52.960 every facial thing has a feeling all of
00:37:55.280 a sudden your team's down there you're

00:37:58.800 also you see
00:38:00.000 tons of people getting up to leave fifth
00:38:02.400 grade teacher ben nathanson has taken
00:38:04.720 that idea of combining fun and learning
00:38:07.599 and turned it into an art form are you
00:38:09.839 mad yeah well show me mad

00:38:50.400 accept that challenge and all i ask for
00:38:52.560 is effort but if i'm not going to come
00:38:53.920 with the enthusiasm
00:38:55.440 they're not going to learn anything so
00:38:57.359 it's my personality to take the humor
00:38:59.280 and look for the humor in somebody and
00:39:01.280 draw it out of them did you change your
00:39:03.119 expression ben nathanson doesn't simply
00:39:05.440 have his students read out loud
00:39:07.920 they take this poem search for the
00:39:10.000 emotional elements then act them out
00:39:13.359 casey's coming look here he comes look
00:39:15.359 at him yeah yeah that's expression folks
00:39:18.240 not
00:39:19.359 i want them to get excited about reading
00:39:21.200 words are fun words can do things to you
00:39:23.520 if you use a little drama with it
00:39:25.839 if you use expressions and make them
00:39:27.680 feel it when they go to their desk you
00:39:29.680 got them started you got a fire built in
00:39:31.760 them casey's coming to back you've got a
00:39:33.760 chance to win all right dj's jumping up
00:39:36.320 for joy they're going counting his money
00:39:38.000 man i got money on this game and you
00:39:40.480 challenge them i'm challenging those
00:39:42.240 kids to find a different way to do it
00:39:44.000 right so you've got to believe what
00:39:45.599 you're pretending to see what are you
00:39:47.520 pretending to see casey's coming show me
00:39:49.760 casey and then they pick apart the story
00:39:52.079 slowly and they see it differently
00:39:53.760 that's exciting for a child versus
00:39:55.680 here's the book read it answer the
00:39:56.960 questions
00:39:58.079 that's not exciting
00:39:59.300 
00:40:00.720 things are exciting back at the hockey
00:40:02.720 game the students have a penalty shot
00:40:04.960 
00:40:07.359 the contest for the kubasaw cup is tied
00:40:10.400 teachers won students won
00:40:13.599 okay how was this story how was her
00:40:15.760 story different from the original fairy
00:40:17.599 tale this is another school-wide
00:40:19.680 activity something called shared reading
00:40:23.119 each week students gather in small
00:40:25.040 groups to read stories they've written
00:40:27.280 launches to aid us in the battle we only
00:40:29.920 have 20 warriors
00:40:32.079 when holly got there she obviously it is
00:40:34.800 a very academic directed program the
00:40:38.079 opportunity for children to engage in
00:40:41.119 quality writing skills
00:40:42.980 
00:40:44.480 but also there is a social component to
00:40:47.200 it as well the children then have the
00:40:49.280 opportunity to meet with all
00:40:53.200 grade levels in the school and share
00:40:55.359 their writing and so it goes back to the
00:40:58.400 idea that academics and behavior can fit
00:41:01.760 very well together
00:41:03.520 yes
00:41:04.839 thorncliffe good behavior goes hand in
00:41:07.440 hand with academic success
00:41:10.160 and if a student isn't succeeding
00:41:12.400 there's plenty of extra support
00:41:13.920 available you go ahead and try and
00:41:15.440 distract them
00:41:17.280 pat castoros teaches a skills class if
00:41:20.560 students are disruptive or have trouble
00:41:22.640 paying attention they come here for one
00:41:25.200 period to learn some basic interpersonal
00:41:27.680 skills yeah
00:41:30.000 keep trying be real persistent corey
00:41:34.400 yesley
00:41:35.760 cory keeps poking his pencil and
00:41:38.400 distracting me oh no so how does that
00:41:40.800 make you feel
00:41:42.000 sad sad
00:41:43.760 and mad
00:41:44.960 well you've done a good job by telling
00:41:46.720 us what's going on instead of just
00:41:48.480 poking them back right
00:41:50.480 the skills class has a single purpose to
00:41:53.280 get these students ready and able to
00:41:55.280 learn back of the guy pushing them back
00:41:57.760 and forth if they are able to have some
00:42:00.319 self-control and
00:42:02.480 manage their behavior within a classroom
00:42:04.560 and
00:42:05.359 listen to the teacher then they're
00:42:06.640 picking up on the lessons that the
00:42:08.000 teachers trying to teach them
00:42:09.680 that in turn helps their academic skills
00:42:12.000 which in turn
00:42:13.280 later in life can can benefit them in
00:42:15.680 the workplace
00:42:17.599 thorncliffe teachers talk often about
00:42:19.599 preparing their students for later life
00:42:22.319 so when ted davis has his fourth graders
00:42:24.560 read a story they do it in small groups
00:42:28.240 the focus isn't on just reading
00:42:30.720 but also on cooperation
00:42:34.640 they come into my classroom we have to
00:42:36.160 cooperate with each other we're a team
00:42:38.160 we work together we're a group what
00:42:40.000 we're trying to do at this school is
00:42:41.040 prepare them for
00:42:42.319 for once they get out of this school and
00:42:45.520 no matter where they go in their life
00:42:46.800 they're going to have to cooperate with
00:42:48.000 somebody whether it's standing in a
00:42:49.200 bread line or applying for a job and the
00:42:52.560 idea of teamwork is is very very
00:42:54.640 important
00:42:55.599 eight times six
00:42:59.280 okay team three gets this is another
00:43:01.839 effort to make learning as engaging as
00:43:03.920 possible
00:43:05.040 when it's time to work on math ted davis
00:43:07.680 breaks his class into teams
00:43:10.319 my class was weak in the multiplication
00:43:11.920 facts
00:43:13.119 so i try and bring in these little games
00:43:14.560 like the multiplication relay where they
00:43:16.000 go up to the board they have fun with it
00:43:18.160 make it a bit more incentive
00:43:20.560 and
00:43:21.680 eight times eight again the team effort
00:43:23.920 you work together
00:43:28.000 meanwhile the student hockey team works
00:43:30.480 together to break the tie
00:43:34.160 with time running out the students hold
00:43:36.400 a two to one lead over the teachers
00:43:40.160 nine
00:43:41.359 planes
00:43:43.280 three
00:43:44.319 planes fly
00:43:46.960 away
00:43:48.720 nine
00:43:49.920 take away three
00:43:51.839 yeah
00:43:54.460 
00:43:58.400 there's a concentrated effort at
00:44:00.000 thorncliffe to improve self-esteem
00:44:02.800 an effort that begins on the first day
00:44:04.800 of school
00:44:06.319 joanne moulter wants her first graders
00:44:08.400 to experience success very early
00:44:11.680 even a simple success like solving a
00:44:14.000 math problem
00:44:16.800 can you look at the picture or use your
00:44:18.319 fingers
00:44:23.600 
00:44:26.960 keep going looks good
00:44:29.119 before you can teach you have to have
00:44:30.800 the kids feeling good about themselves i
00:44:32.319 think they go in hand i don't think you
00:44:33.760 can have
00:44:34.800 the academics just academic the kids are
00:44:37.200 not going to be motivated to learn
00:44:39.050 
00:44:42.079 they have to feel good about themselves
00:44:43.760 and when they do that then you can teach
00:44:46.000 them then they will learn and achieve
00:44:48.560 the emperor's new clothes by hans
00:44:50.400 kristen anderson self-esteem is also
00:44:53.280 enhanced by support from other students
00:44:55.760 in pauline drinkwater's class second
00:44:58.240 graders read a story and make analogies
00:45:01.040 between themselves and the main
00:45:02.640 character
00:45:05.020 
00:45:07.440 the rest of the class is then invited to
00:45:09.359 make comments the emphasis is on the
00:45:11.920 positive i am
00:45:14.160 i am do agree that
00:45:16.160 you aren't as
00:45:18.640 as foolish as i can
00:45:21.680 erin
00:45:22.960 um evan i agree with you that you don't
00:45:25.760 wear royal clothing he does
00:45:28.000 okay thanks for sharing that one
00:45:32.000 half a dozen cookies cost two dollars 70
00:45:34.960 cents what is the cost of one well the
00:45:37.119 information if we look at it like this
00:45:41.359 you have half a dozen cookies that
00:45:43.280 represents half a dozen cookies right
00:45:46.079 you are correct is that the only
00:45:47.680 information you need to solve the
00:45:48.720 problem
00:45:50.079 the focus on self-esteem continues in
00:45:52.480 the later grades
00:45:54.480 ben nathanson is teaching his fifth
00:45:56.160 graders how to solve math problems
00:45:58.560 right now we know that half a dozen
00:46:00.640 cookies cost 270. but most of the
00:46:03.200 knowledge is produced by the students
00:46:05.040 themselves is he missing one more thing
00:46:07.119 in that problem
00:46:09.680 is there anything else in the
00:46:10.560 mathematical problem you need to draw
00:46:15.680 give them the sheet so you can read the
00:46:16.880 problem quickly are you sure ray that's
00:46:18.960 the only thing you need
00:46:21.440 hands if you know there's something
00:46:22.560 missing
00:46:24.560 just one person
00:46:26.400 holly's not sure she's halfway down now
00:46:28.560 she's positive she's guessing mr
00:46:30.319 robinson looks confident
00:46:32.480 mr paquette you don't look so confident
00:46:36.720 are you happy with it yeah ask your
00:46:38.400 partner if he's happy with it
00:46:40.400 yeah okay so elevator down
00:46:43.040 you're not happy with it
00:46:46.319 no step one we're still step one
00:46:49.440 mr robinson um it
00:46:52.079 doesn't tell you that you have to find
00:46:54.000 out
00:46:54.720 what the price of one cookie is so
00:46:57.920 should you not draw an arrow draw one
00:47:00.079 and say cost
00:47:01.839 question mark
00:47:03.280 like what are we supposed to find out as
00:47:04.560 far as you're concerned
00:47:06.160 we got the answer right here two dollars
00:47:08.400 70 cents half a dozen
00:47:10.160 what a waste of time
00:47:11.920 because all this information is not
00:47:13.359 leading back to here
00:47:15.680 so could you have drawn that
00:47:17.760 yeah how many did how many took it that
00:47:19.839 extra step
00:47:21.119 how many did not how many have
00:47:22.839 this if you took it one more step i vow
00:47:26.000 to you congratulations you took it an
00:47:28.160 extra step you thought this much more
00:47:30.960 don't get us wrong here with our
00:47:32.240 philosophy about self-esteem just leave
00:47:34.319 it like that
00:47:35.359 academics is important to us
00:47:37.599 i think if you check our records i think
00:47:39.440 you'll see the academic standing of a
00:47:41.200 lot of these kids and i think we can
00:47:43.440 stand tall with our heads up saying
00:47:45.440 we're not just touchy feely we're not
00:47:47.520 into that we're into the human being and
00:47:49.839 doing the best that they possibly can do
00:47:51.920 and academics is very important to us at
00:47:54.319 this school but self-worth self-esteem
00:47:57.680 starts it all off
00:47:59.200 the reason that we're getting together
00:48:01.760 is to make our community a graffiti free
00:48:05.920 community there's a major effort at
00:48:08.079 thorncliffe to connect students with the
00:48:10.079 world outside of school
00:48:12.160 donna granger's class wants to get rid
00:48:14.079 of graffiti in edmonton graffiti isn't
00:48:17.359 just what it says in the dictionary
00:48:19.359 graffiti is
00:48:21.359 all about feelings
00:48:24.640 and stop and think for a moment
00:48:27.520 all right let's start over here one of
00:48:29.520 your feelings was
00:48:31.760 embarrassed
00:48:33.040 just feel sorry for him or her sorry
00:48:36.720 we feel embarrassed we feel sorry
00:48:39.040 and your group please you feel scared
00:48:41.280 thank you these students don't just talk
00:48:43.440 about graffiti mad they try to do
00:48:46.160 something about it that includes making
00:48:49.280 a phone call to city hall
00:48:51.920 what has to be
00:48:53.760 um
00:48:55.200 the graffiti
00:48:57.200 all right let's help them
00:49:01.740 
00:49:06.400 this is another learning activity that
00:49:08.400 takes place out of the classroom
00:49:10.800 the corn cliff rocket club is putting on
00:49:12.960 a show
00:49:19.160 
00:49:21.920 the rocket club was the idea of school
00:49:24.160 counselor pat fizzell
00:49:26.400 the idea that we put children
00:49:29.119 in a little box called school and we
00:49:31.200 invest their childhood there
00:49:33.280 i don't believe has been overly
00:49:34.640 successful
00:49:35.920 at dawn cliff school we invest child
00:49:38.480 children in the daily act of living in
00:49:40.880 the daily act of making their world a
00:49:42.960 little bit better
00:49:44.720 things are going a little bit better for
00:49:46.559 the teachers
00:49:47.839 they score to even the hockey game at
00:49:49.920 two goals apiece
00:49:53.650 


00:49:57.119 this big match will be decided by a
00:49:59.520 shootout
00:50:01.280 i'm asking you to begin to read
00:50:03.520 on your own and take some responsibility
00:50:05.359 for this for yourself okay i don't want
00:50:07.599 you to be dependent on me
00:50:09.440 these are well within your reading
00:50:11.119 levels and i'm expecting you
00:50:13.839 to work on them to get started while the
00:50:16.640 general belief at thorncliffe is that
00:50:18.400 all students can succeed
00:50:20.319 there's support for children who are
00:50:21.920 having difficulty i'm expecting you to
00:50:24.079 take the responsibility of reading this
00:50:25.520 yourself right now okay great thanks
00:50:27.760 very much how to be brian ferguson
00:50:29.920 teaches a group of students with
00:50:31.359 emotional and behavioral problems
00:50:34.160 the idea is to eventually get these kids
00:50:36.720 back into a regular classroom i see work
00:50:39.280 in the meantime
00:50:40.480 they're taught the regular curriculum
00:50:42.640 and offered as much attention and
00:50:44.400 encouragement as possible nice job guys
00:50:47.599 okay newbie
00:50:49.119 really in there with me and a real
00:50:50.800 contributor today and i really
00:50:52.240 appreciate that thanks very much leo
00:50:55.040 nice job right in there like a bear way
00:50:57.040 to go how to be
00:50:58.800 so let's go to page nine
00:51:01.760 and you read all over on how they look
00:51:04.480 one more special class is made up of
00:51:06.559 children who have fallen at least two
00:51:08.400 years behind their classmates i guess i
00:51:10.720 would describe them as i have a family
00:51:12.400 of 11 children they
00:51:14.640 um
00:51:15.520 range in age from 9 to 13.
00:51:18.559 do you know what a high monica ullman
00:51:20.400 teaches the class again the goal is to
00:51:23.359 have these students catch up and move on
00:51:27.040 they come feeling very left out
00:51:30.960 some of them actually come with quite a
00:51:33.119 chip on their shoulder saying things
00:51:35.119 like i'm stupid
00:51:37.040 end of story they believe that and they
00:51:39.839 would repeat that quite often at the
00:51:41.440 beginning of the year yes he used to
00:51:43.200 live in europe my philosophy as a
00:51:45.119 teacher is
00:51:46.720 whether it's with special needs students
00:51:48.720 or with regular students is that
00:51:51.359 all children can have successes if
00:51:54.880 the
00:51:56.480 situation is set up very carefully at
00:51:59.119 the beginning so that those successes
00:52:01.280 are very meaningful to them
00:52:03.440 there's a continual effort at
00:52:04.960 thorncliffe to monitor all students
00:52:07.520 an effort that goes beyond the usual
00:52:09.440 standardized tests
00:52:11.599 the school has developed its own
00:52:13.119 assessment program in which each child
00:52:15.440 is tested at the beginning of the school
00:52:17.280 year and again at the end of the year
00:52:20.640 we are
00:52:21.839 more interested in individual growth
00:52:25.440 for students over the course of the year
00:52:28.480 than comparing them to other learning
00:52:31.119 groups either in the city or in the
00:52:33.839 province
00:52:35.040 we are able to do that by identifying
00:52:38.480 the change that takes place between
00:52:40.960 their achievement level at the beginning
00:52:43.599 of the year and at the end of the year
00:52:46.000 the classic pre and post-test assessment
00:52:48.480 profile
00:52:49.920 if testing shows a child is falling
00:52:51.920 behind
00:52:52.960 teachers at thorncliffe search for new
00:52:55.040 and different strategies
00:52:57.200 all around the school there were
00:52:58.559 reminders to the staff
00:53:00.480 they're expected to do anything it takes
00:53:02.880 to reach every child it's a team effort
00:53:06.000 i will not say to the child you did not
00:53:08.240 succeed it's we did not succeed and that
00:53:10.880 includes the parent it's a triangle and
00:53:12.720 the kid has to know it's a triangle and
00:53:14.800 it's it's the school the teacher the
00:53:17.119 parent and the child and we truly
00:53:18.960 believe that here at thorncliffe if a
00:53:21.520 child in the in the classroom is having
00:53:23.520 difficulty learning the teachers have
00:53:25.920 committed themselves to working with
00:53:27.920 that child certainly within the
00:53:29.760 classroom but outside the classroom as
00:53:32.319 well as networking with the parents to
00:53:34.960 ensure that that child will succeed
00:53:39.520 parents have played a critical role in
00:53:41.440 thorncliffe's transformation
00:53:43.440 whether it's tutoring children or
00:53:45.359 monitoring the playground
00:53:48.160 25 minutes
00:53:49.680 after scene after six we have another
00:53:52.079 bingo coming up on tuesday and we were
00:53:54.480 wondering if you'd be able to work it
00:53:56.240 cheryl rose is president of the parental
00:53:58.400 advisory council
00:54:00.079 which has more than a hundred members
00:54:03.200 once a month the council runs a bingo
00:54:05.280 game at the west edmonton mall
00:54:09.280 they raise enough money to pay for most
00:54:11.359 of the school's field trips
00:54:14.160 we have a tendency to find out that
00:54:15.599 budgets have been cut and the
00:54:18.000 schools don't don't always have enough
00:54:19.839 funding to do exactly what they want to
00:54:21.680 do
00:54:22.400 and whatever they've decided to do which
00:54:24.400 isn't saying that it isn't enough for
00:54:26.000 the kids but we just like to give that
00:54:27.680 little extra so that you know the kids
00:54:29.920 get the best that they can possibly get
00:54:32.640 ladies and gentlemen here we go
00:54:34.480 good luck ray
00:54:37.599 back at the hockey game the shootout is
00:54:40.000 nearly over he's going to shoot
00:54:43.280 eventually
00:54:48.240 the students score to go ahead by one
00:54:51.200 the teachers are down to their last
00:54:53.040 chance i don't believe it i don't
00:54:55.119 believe it
00:54:57.359 here we go
00:55:00.240 if they miss this shot the game is over
00:55:08.079 the students win the game and the famous
00:55:11.119 kuba saw cup
00:55:12.960 at least until next year
00:55:16.559 lou yanu has accomplished his initial
00:55:18.720 goal he's changed the environment of an
00:55:21.760 entire school
00:55:23.359 and the attitude of an entire student
00:55:25.760 body
00:55:26.780 
00:55:43.520 we thought
00:55:44.940 
00:55:56.720 our team works and does its best
00:55:59.920 we have terrific students here fantastic
00:56:04.000 teachers
00:56:05.060 
00:56:13.559 principals and voices
00:56:16.340 
00:56:28.480 can i know what i'm doing thorncliff
00:56:30.160 community school has become a haven a
00:56:33.040 place to enjoy
00:56:34.640 and a place to learn
00:56:36.640 once a school has the base foundation of
00:56:40.720 strong solid supportive discipline as
00:56:44.319 well as a vibrant spirited inviting
00:56:47.760 culture in climate
00:56:49.839 academics
00:56:51.280 hard
00:56:52.640 well fine-tuned academics can
00:56:56.960 be brought into a school with much more
00:57:00.799 enthusiasm
00:57:02.240 with the base foundation in place
00:57:04.400 teachers are more empowered and
00:57:06.000 enthusiastic
00:57:07.599 and find the energy
00:57:09.440 to engage in curriculum development and
00:57:12.400 redevelopment across the top of your

00:57:19.920 entire school
00:57:22.000 but he says he's done just one thing
00:57:24.640 assemble an all-star team of teachers
00:57:27.599 the role of the coach like a hockey
00:57:29.920 coach is to bring the highest quality of
00:57:32.960 players to play on that team and the
00:57:35.680 thorncliffe team has players that are of
00:57:38.640 a quality that could go out on at any
00:57:41.119 one given moment and win the stanley cup
