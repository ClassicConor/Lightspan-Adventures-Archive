my students really enjoy lifespan it's
very appealing to them they like the
graphics they like the storyline it's
very age appropriate for them they
choose to do it when they have free time
spare time when the lightspan program
Stratus goes into the home with parents
and students working together I see that
there's going to be a lot of
communication happening between parent
and child as well as problem solving so
what did you do in school today
I adjusted my angle by 60
. the lifespan concept of parents and
families and teachers and students all
working together is a very very
important one you want to check out
family activities okay okay
in sixth grade reading if students are
using the lifespan program at home with
their parents they'll be actually
reading more they're also learning about
characters in history they're problem
solving they're learning vocabulary so
this can only benefit their education
