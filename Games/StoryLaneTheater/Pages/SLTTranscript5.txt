00:00:47.280 come on
00:00:48.760 in settle
00:00:51.120 back it's curtain time at the story lane
00:00:54.559 theater you've never seen a stage like
00:00:57.000 this
00:00:58.120 one anything can happen
00:01:13.960 here today's main attraction is called
00:01:16.960 Peach boy it's a traditional Japanese
00:01:20.040 story about a young boy who mysteriously
00:01:22.720 enters the lives of an elderly couple
00:01:25.119 and grows up to do battle with a band of
00:01:27.400 dreaded
00:01:28.560 ogres but the before we enter the
00:01:30.880 unforgettable world of Peach Boy let's
00:01:33.439 visit with Jeffrey Smith he's the artist
00:01:36.159 who painted the pictures you'll see in
00:01:37.600 the show and he's at work in his
00:01:40.040 California
00:01:42.040 Studio when I was in high school a good
00:01:45.280 friend of mine was a sign painter and I
00:01:48.079 would go to his shop and watch him paint
00:01:51.200 letter forms with a brush it was uh
00:01:54.960 amazing to see this person use a brush
00:01:58.399 and make these beautiful letter forms
00:02:00.799 um it was a great influence for me so I
00:02:04.640 think that stayed with me uh through my
00:02:07.079 education in art school and um it's just
00:02:10.520 one of those things that it happens
00:02:13.040 early and then it just stays inside of
00:02:15.440 you and when you get the chance you use
00:02:20.660 [Music]
00:02:25.840 it I was just very excited about the
00:02:29.400 story of Peach Boy the minute I read it
00:02:32.480 I loved
00:02:34.720 it normally when I paint I paint with
00:02:41.760 watercolor being that it was a story
00:02:44.760 from Japan I decided to use materials
00:02:49.440 that are from Japan materials that were
00:02:52.959 just very different from what I use
00:02:54.440 they're called ink
00:02:56.040 sticks you take these little colored
00:02:58.959 sticks they're about 4 in long and an
00:03:01.200 inch wide each stick has its own color
00:03:04.200 say there's a yellow one and they each
00:03:06.159 have their own little dish and you put
00:03:09.159 water in the dish you take your ink
00:03:11.480 stick and you grind it into the water
00:03:13.920 and the dish and you make ink you dip
00:03:16.799 the brush into the ink and you paint
00:03:20.720 onto what we call rice paper which is a
00:03:26.080 semi-transparent a sort of translucent
00:03:28.760 surface
00:03:30.470 [Music]
00:03:39.480 a couple of my favorite Japanese artists
00:03:41.879 are Hokusai and Hiro shig their work
00:03:46.000 illustrates their culture now this book
00:03:48.680 in particular was very interesting to me
00:03:51.159 because it can be seen as a um a book
00:03:57.159 such as we expect to see a book where
00:03:59.920 you work your way through the pages and
00:04:03.360 look at the art on the other hand it can
00:04:06.079 be
00:04:06.959 pulled
00:04:09.400 apart uh and seen as one long panel the
00:04:14.360 story of peach boy is essentially a
00:04:16.759 journey and so when I began to develop
00:04:20.959 the artwork it seemed such a wonderful
00:04:24.040 idea to Ed horizontal and vertical
00:04:27.320 panels of
00:04:28.720 Art
00:04:29.730 [Music]
00:04:31.199 and it was very helpful because for this
00:04:34.759 very big moment in the story I needed to
00:04:38.000 make a piece of art that was really
00:04:41.720 special and a piece of art that was
00:04:45.840 continuous it connected several
00:04:49.680 ideas so this is a very long piece of um
00:04:53.800 art and at this point in the story Peach
00:04:56.800 Boy and um the dog and the ape and the
00:05:01.039 Pheasant are sailing toward the island
00:05:03.080 of the
00:05:04.440 ogres as they're sailing all of the
00:05:07.759 animals of the sea the Dolphins flying
00:05:09.800 fish and whales and thousands and
00:05:11.960 thousands of birds join in a kind of
00:05:15.639 procession during all of this
00:05:18.600 celebration Peach Boy imagines that
00:05:20.919 perhaps he uh is really just dreaming
00:05:25.280 this uh cuz it's so glorious and that uh
00:05:28.680 perhaps he is in
00:05:31.240 heaven and then finally we see uh as he
00:05:34.840 would if he were in heaven a sort of
00:05:36.880 high Vantage Point view of the ship in
00:05:40.160 the
00:05:41.319 water the journey is just a great
00:05:44.240 example for a life it's just a great way
00:05:47.600 to tell a
00:05:50.680 story Peach Boy is a simple story that
00:05:55.000 has lasted for hundreds of years and
00:05:58.520 appeals to
00:06:00.240 kids in probably any
00:06:04.240 culture I hope that the kids in this
00:06:07.599 country that see this tape will come to
00:06:10.280 appreciate what is specific to the
00:06:15.039 Japanese
00:06:16.520 culture and also what our two cultures
00:06:19.639 share in
00:06:22.520 common and now let's settle back and
00:06:25.759 watch the story of Peach
00:06:28.560 Boy
00:06:30.440 [Music]
00:07:11.440 [Music]
00:07:20.120 Once Upon a Time in ancient
00:07:22.960 Japan there lived an old wood cutter and
00:07:25.879 his
00:07:27.639 wife many years before before their
00:07:30.919 children had been stolen by a band of
00:07:34.639 horrible
00:07:40.280 ogres the couple had not had other
00:07:42.720 children after that and had long since
00:07:45.560 given up thinking about it for they were
00:07:48.159 very
00:07:48.880 [Music]
00:07:51.919 old but every now and then as they sat
00:07:55.280 on their Veranda at the end of the day
00:07:58.039 and watched the blue sky
00:08:00.240 transformed by the orange and peach
00:08:02.759 colors of the Setting Sun tears would
00:08:06.000 come into their eyes and they would sigh
00:08:09.440 and remember the voices of their long
00:08:11.599 lost little ones and wonder what it
00:08:14.159 might be like to have a child
00:08:16.410 [Music]
00:08:21.560 again now one day as the old woman was
00:08:25.440 washing her clothes in a nearby
00:08:27.840 stream she saw a large brilliant object
00:08:32.919 that looked like a peach pobing along in
00:08:36.080 the water just beyond
00:08:38.360 [Music]
00:08:41.719 her the object was so large that she
00:08:45.240 knew it was not a peach and could never
00:08:47.839 be
00:08:50.360 one but when at last she reached it and
00:08:53.240 beheld it closely she saw that it was a
00:08:56.519 peach after
00:08:58.440 all and when she picked it up she saw
00:09:02.160 that it was nearly as large as the
00:09:04.320 basket in which she carried her
00:09:09.440 clothes so she brought the peach
00:09:13.160 home and then sat on the veranda waiting
00:09:16.440 for her husband to come
00:09:23.040 home he was still a great distance off
00:09:26.560 when she saw him and called out oh
00:09:30.279 son
00:09:32.399 oisan I have found a giant peach come
00:09:37.279 quickly now the old man was carrying an
00:09:40.120 exceptionally large load of wood upon
00:09:42.120 his back that day but on hearing his old
00:09:44.920 wife call out to him huffing and puffing
00:09:48.720 he hurried up the path to their home
00:09:51.839 when he saw her sitting there on The
00:09:53.519 Veranda with the Monumental Peach he put
00:09:57.880 the wood down and rubbed his eyes
00:10:00.640 thinking that perhaps because he was so
00:10:03.040 weary he was imagining things but he
00:10:06.760 soon saw that the unlikely fruit was
00:10:09.440 quite real and he marveled at it and
00:10:13.680 after they had beheld its magnificence
00:10:15.680 for some time they decided to eat it for
00:10:20.720 supper the weary oisan produced a large
00:10:24.600 knife and proceeded to slice the giant
00:10:27.600 object carefully in two hands
00:10:32.720 s just as he came near the middle though
00:10:36.560 a little voice cried
00:10:40.480 out before the old couple knew what was
00:10:43.519 happening the two halves of the vast
00:10:46.279 Peach fell apart and a tiny child came
00:10:51.320 out of the fruit Center and stood before
00:10:54.519 them dripping
00:10:56.670 [Music]
00:10:58.240 wet now of course the old couple was
00:11:02.000 quite dumbfounded and they could only
00:11:04.600 look at each other and
00:11:07.360 shrug but after a time it became clear
00:11:11.000 to them that now even at this late point
00:11:14.160 in their lives they would again know the
00:11:16.959 joy of having a child all their
00:11:22.959 own their happiness on beholding the
00:11:25.839 little child and on realizing what had
00:11:28.720 befallen in the Twilight of their lives
00:11:31.720 was so
00:11:33.240 unspeakable that they sat and wept for
00:11:36.399 many hours and together experienced the
00:11:39.800 Singular Sensation of not knowing what
00:11:42.560 to do with their hands or
00:11:48.000 feet the years that followed were ones
00:11:51.000 of great joy for the old
00:11:53.000 couple and now when at the end of each
00:11:56.560 day they sat on the Vera watching
00:11:59.200 watching the sun crawl under The
00:12:01.040 Horizon's covers for the night the Peach
00:12:04.040 Boy watched it with
00:12:07.680 them and for the first time in their
00:12:10.320 lives the powerful longing that came to
00:12:13.160 them at this time of day found its long
00:12:16.199 deserved and proper
00:12:18.290 [Music]
00:12:23.360 rest now as you may have heard the peach
00:12:26.720 boy or momotaro as they came to call him
00:12:31.160 grew much more quickly than your average
00:12:33.399 child in fact he grew so quickly that in
00:12:37.880 only 5 years time he was celebrating his
00:12:41.120 15th birthday the old couple hardly knew
00:12:44.600 what to make of the strange fact but
00:12:47.120 they were simple people with few
00:12:50.199 expectations and so they came to accept
00:12:52.959 it as a matter of
00:12:54.760 course one day soon thereafter Peach Boy
00:12:58.760 made an announcement to his venerable
00:13:00.720 foster
00:13:01.959 parents it is time I went out into the
00:13:05.079 wide world and proved myself as a man he
00:13:08.279 told them there is an island far beyond
00:13:12.079 the Northeast sea which is inhabited by
00:13:15.399 a band of hideous ogres I must travel
00:13:19.800 there and conquer them but fear not for
00:13:24.079 I shall be
00:13:25.519 Victorious and I promise to return to
00:13:28.040 you when I I have won back the precious
00:13:30.560 plunder which those murdering thieves
00:13:33.040 have stolen all these
00:13:35.600 years now momotaro was indeed bigger and
00:13:39.000 stronger than anyone they had ever seen
00:13:41.639 and his Fame had spread throughout all
00:13:43.600 of
00:13:44.639 Japan but the old couple had grown to
00:13:47.600 love him more dearly than anything in
00:13:49.519 their lives and the Very thought of
00:13:52.480 losing another dear child to the Hideous
00:13:56.079 ogres caused them to tremble
00:14:00.160 in the end though their love for the boy
00:14:02.800 was so great that they were unable to
00:14:05.440 deny him the desire of his heart and so
00:14:08.399 they
00:14:09.600 ascented the old man rummaged about and
00:14:12.600 found a limber walking stick a rusting
00:14:15.600 iron gunson which served as a shield in
00:14:17.839 Warfare and finally a tattered Old Flag
00:14:22.240 which his father had given him some 50
00:14:24.639 years before and he gave these objects
00:14:27.440 to motaro
00:14:32.480 the old woman ground millet seeds in the
00:14:34.880 kitchen mortar and with tears in her
00:14:37.360 eyes she cooked her beloved Boy A Feast
00:14:40.240 of dumplings over the charcoal
00:14:43.720 fire she then wrapped them up in a
00:14:46.120 furoshiki and gave the bundle to him for
00:14:48.560 his
00:14:49.390 [Music]
00:14:51.199 journey their farewell was a long and
00:14:53.720 tearful one but finally momotaro
00:14:57.000 departed from them and set off by
00:14:59.279 himself at Daybreak into the wide
00:15:01.780 [Music]
00:15:05.320 world he walked and walked for what
00:15:08.279 seemed many
00:15:10.639 hours until finally he came into a
00:15:13.440 strange country in which the colors and
00:15:16.880 shapes were unlike anything he had ever
00:15:19.560 seen
00:15:25.600 before after a while he began to feel
00:15:29.079 tired and lonely so we sat down in a
00:15:33.000 large field beneath a tree to rest and
00:15:35.440 have a bite to
00:15:38.000 eat but when he opened his bag and
00:15:40.959 smelled the Millet dumplings that his
00:15:42.639 dear mother had made for him with her
00:15:44.240 own hands great tears welled up in his
00:15:51.079 eyes just as he was finished eating
00:15:54.120 there was a terrific rustling in the
00:15:55.959 bushes nearby and suddenly a huge dog
00:15:59.920 the size of a Colt bounded out toward
00:16:03.000 him what are you doing trespassing on my
00:16:06.000 land the dog inquired roughly moving his
00:16:09.199 head from side to
00:16:10.880 side you better give me those dumplings
00:16:13.720 or I won't be responsible for my actions
00:16:15.800 toward
00:16:16.720 you and he continued to move his head
00:16:19.240 from side to side eyeing the dumplings
00:16:22.560 ho ho mumara replied see here little
00:16:26.120 doggy as I remember dogs can't can't
00:16:29.120 even talk how is it then that you have
00:16:32.000 the audacity not only to talk but to
00:16:34.519 demand of me the very dumplings which my
00:16:37.000 poor mother made for me with her own
00:16:39.480 hands realizing that it was indeed the
00:16:42.399 great Lord momotaro of whom he'd heard
00:16:45.199 the insolent Hound quickly changed his
00:16:48.920 tune oh you are quite right that dogs
00:16:52.360 can't talk Lord momotaro quite right
00:16:55.360 indeed what a silly notion please
00:16:58.120 forgive me I'll never talk again
00:17:00.920 although I I still wouldn't mind one of
00:17:03.240 those fine dumplings and you shall have
00:17:06.000 it momotaro replied will you also
00:17:09.599 accompany me on my journey to the island
00:17:12.319 of ogres across the Northeast
00:17:15.599 sea the dog then said that he would and
00:17:19.039 gladly agreed to be momotaro's military
00:17:23.720 retainer he was then immediately given a
00:17:26.119 dumpling as well as the high honor of
00:17:28.439 carrying Lord momotaro's walking stick
00:17:31.280 and the two of them fell in together and
00:17:33.679 began
00:17:37.720 walking they walked for miles and miles
00:17:41.400 until the countryside became densely
00:17:46.039 wooded when they had grown quite tired
00:17:48.960 and decided to sit down for a bite to
00:17:50.840 eat momotaro untied the ends of the
00:17:53.799 furoshiki containing the dumplings and
00:17:56.520 immediately heard a loud screech in in
00:17:58.960 the tree just above
00:18:01.200 them an ancient orange ape swung down to
00:18:05.559 the
00:18:07.240 ground good day to you Lord momotaro he
00:18:10.880 said I've been expecting you word has
00:18:14.320 traveled far and wide about your
00:18:16.440 Expedition may I have the high honor of
00:18:19.200 accompanying you the honor would be mine
00:18:21.960 alone replied momotaro please have a
00:18:27.760 dumpling
00:18:29.559 now the dog clearly resented the ape's
00:18:31.960 intrusion into things he had hoped to be
00:18:34.679 the only one to accompany
00:18:37.919 momotaro and as they proceeded he and
00:18:40.799 the ape snapped and bitted each other
00:18:43.360 behind momotaro's
00:18:45.080 [Music]
00:18:46.960 back as they were traveling through a
00:18:49.280 Moore the dog left off bickering with
00:18:51.960 the ape just long enough to flush a
00:18:54.159 large pheasant out of some bushes and
00:18:56.440 chase after
00:18:57.720 it
00:19:03.440 the Pheasant proved more than a match
00:19:05.200 for the large dog though and could not
00:19:07.600 be
00:19:09.980 [Music]
00:19:12.240 caught you are quite a valiant fellow
00:19:15.240 momotaro said to the bird we are
00:19:17.960 traveling to the aisle of death to
00:19:20.400 Vanquish the terrible ogres who live
00:19:22.919 there will you do us the honor of
00:19:25.280 joining our
00:19:27.200 party the Fe said that he'd been born
00:19:30.039 for that very purpose and agreed
00:19:34.720 heartily momotaro then tossed up a
00:19:37.480 millet dumpling which the Pheasant
00:19:39.400 caught in midair and
00:19:41.880 [Music]
00:19:44.840 ate as they were traveling along however
00:19:47.880 The Strife between the animals continued
00:19:50.159 until momotaro could stand it no
00:19:54.880 longer now see here he said sternly we
00:19:58.799 shall be quite unable to fulfill our
00:20:00.720 plan if we continue to fight among
00:20:03.000 ourselves the next one of you who steps
00:20:05.559 out of line shall forfeit his place
00:20:07.799 among the
00:20:10.600 group the ape the dog and the Pheasant
00:20:14.280 all looked down at the ground sheepishly
00:20:16.799 for they deeply respected momotaro and
00:20:19.640 they were grieved that they had
00:20:21.320 endangered his
00:20:22.450 [Music]
00:20:25.679 plan they continued to March toward the
00:20:28.360 sea
00:20:29.400 and from that day on they were quite
00:20:37.640 obedient finally after many days of
00:20:40.600 marching they came to a cliff that
00:20:42.960 overlooked the great Northeast
00:20:45.960 sea but look as they might there was not
00:20:49.440 any Island to be
00:20:50.880 [Music]
00:20:54.120 seen my dear pheasant momotaro
00:20:57.080 pronounced solemnly the time has come
00:20:59.919 for you to use your gift of flight you
00:21:03.039 must fly high up into the sky until you
00:21:05.880 see the ogar's
00:21:08.440 island and so the Pheasant ate another
00:21:11.640 Millet dumpling to bolster his strength
00:21:14.279 and took off into the Blue
00:21:17.400 Sky higher and higher and higher he flew
00:21:22.799 until they could see him no
00:21:26.440 more in the hours that passed
00:21:29.080 they constructed a
00:21:35.440 ship then night fell and still the
00:21:38.520 Pheasant did not
00:21:42.919 return finally early the next morning he
00:21:46.000 returned to them completely
00:21:49.559 exhausted he explained to them that he
00:21:52.120 had flown beyond the bless of the sky
00:21:54.520 itself and into a thin clear Realm
00:21:57.720 untraveled by any
00:22:00.060 [Music]
00:22:03.760 birds I had just flown through the horns
00:22:06.799 of the crescent moon when I saw the
00:22:09.640 island of the ogres he
00:22:12.159 explained it will be a long journey but
00:22:15.520 I will lead the way only follow me and
00:22:19.279 we will
00:22:20.680 [Music]
00:22:25.559 prevail and so momotaro and the Pheasant
00:22:30.000 and the dog and the ape rode across the
00:22:33.360 mountains of the Waves toward their
00:22:38.159 destination days and nights came and
00:22:40.600 went as they pressed
00:22:44.440 on at night from the deck of the ship
00:22:47.840 they saw shooting stars Arc across the
00:22:51.000 heavens like wet
00:22:54.279 pearls and when the sun rose in the
00:22:56.559 morning they saw flying fish skittering
00:22:59.320 among the farrows of the
00:23:03.960 Waves word of their Journey traveled far
00:23:06.720 and wide beneath the water's surface so
00:23:09.400 that after a few days a school of
00:23:12.000 brilliant green dolphins rose up
00:23:14.799 alongside to greet them and then leapt
00:23:17.320 ahead of the boat like a military
00:23:20.180 [Music]
00:23:23.240 escort then after some time whales
00:23:27.440 appeared
00:23:29.200 and then many birds began arriving from
00:23:31.440 near lands and then from distant
00:23:35.320 lands at first there were hundreds of
00:23:38.000 them and then thousands and then more
00:23:41.919 thousands and they too escorted the boat
00:23:45.320 flying alongside in great multitudes
00:23:48.200 embroidering the air with
00:23:55.279 song after many weeks the water around
00:23:58.720 the boat boiled with dolphins and
00:24:01.000 countless other beautiful fish and the
00:24:03.760 birds continued to come from every part
00:24:05.880 of the globe until it seemed there was
00:24:08.400 not a bird or fish alive that had not
00:24:10.880 come to join the Fantastic
00:24:13.530 [Music]
00:24:15.159 procession they traveled along like this
00:24:17.480 for many days until the sky became so
00:24:21.080 filled with music and color and the sea
00:24:24.640 with Fish And spouting Wales and the
00:24:27.640 bright turquo PA backs of the leaping
00:24:30.240 dolphins that momotaro thought that
00:24:33.159 perhaps he was in heaven and had only
00:24:35.640 dreamt of his life on Earth and his trip
00:24:38.159 to the island of the
00:24:41.799 ogres but one day he was watching the
00:24:45.000 sunset from the deck of his ship and as
00:24:47.880 it gathered weight and began to droop
00:24:50.640 slowly toward the Horizon it reminded
00:24:53.880 him of a large overripe Peach hanging
00:24:58.399 from a
00:25:00.200 branch then he thought of his
00:25:02.799 Origins and of his years among the old
00:25:05.279 couple who had raised him and of how he
00:25:07.919 had vowed to destroy the
00:25:09.960 ogres and he knew that life was not a
00:25:13.679 dream and that he existed in a world
00:25:16.279 that was cohabited by death and that he
00:25:19.440 was not in
00:25:20.310 [Music]
00:25:21.559 heaven no not
00:25:25.640 yet and he wept
00:25:30.700 [Music]
00:25:32.760 when he awoke it was
00:25:34.279 morning he looked up at the Horizon and
00:25:37.360 then saw in the distance the tiny dot
00:25:40.080 which was the aisle of
00:25:43.440 [Music]
00:25:45.440 death already at that distance the acrid
00:25:49.039 stench of sulfur fumes burned his
00:25:53.279 nostrils and the water became a lifeless
00:25:56.080 greenish
00:25:57.240 color and the fish and the dolphins and
00:26:00.600 whales and birds fell back now for they
00:26:03.600 could go no
00:26:06.880 further when the ship landed momotaro
00:26:10.399 observed that the island was covered
00:26:12.600 everywhere with tall plumes of yellow
00:26:15.039 and greenish smoke from the Sulfur
00:26:17.399 Springs he had heard of and the
00:26:19.520 shoreline was parched and cracked and
00:26:22.480 coated with
00:26:24.559 salt there was nothing but death and S
00:26:28.360 silence in the
00:26:30.640 air they walked along in this blank
00:26:33.360 landscape and saw no
00:26:36.720 life after they had walked a long while
00:26:40.360 they came to a grotesque Fortress made
00:26:43.399 entirely out of human
00:26:49.279 bones by now the ogres will have heard
00:26:51.960 of our arrival pronounced the ape they
00:26:54.840 are perfect cowards and will try to
00:26:57.559 escape into the the bowels of the Earth
00:26:59.120 with their captives and plunder we must
00:27:02.880 hurry the Pheasant was quickly
00:27:05.039 dispatched to report on things and soon
00:27:08.679 returned the ogres are running about in
00:27:11.240 complete panic and are indeed trying to
00:27:13.919 gather up their plunder he said momotaro
00:27:17.440 had a
00:27:21.200 plan in a moment the Pheasant again flew
00:27:24.640 up over the Battlement and began
00:27:26.760 callling out the great Lord momotaro has
00:27:31.440 come the great Lord momotaro has
00:27:37.159 come then the dog ran along the walls of
00:27:40.080 the Fortress and barked oh the great
00:27:42.919 Lord motaro has come the great Lord
00:27:45.880 motaro Has
00:27:49.480 Come finally the ape clambered up to the
00:27:52.799 top of the Fortress wall and ran along
00:27:55.120 it shouting the great Lord M heart has
00:27:58.640 come the great Lord motaro Has
00:28:02.640 Come on hearing this news the ogur
00:28:07.039 nashed their teeth and pulled their
00:28:09.600 horns
00:28:10.460 [Music]
00:28:11.519 out then in their fear and confusion
00:28:15.559 they began attacking each
00:28:20.399 other finally the den of their wailing
00:28:23.919 and panic was so great that the very
00:28:27.039 walls of the Fortress
00:28:28.640 itself began to
00:28:33.799 crumble as the walls fell momotaro
00:28:37.320 immediately climbed over the
00:28:40.080 rubble on seeing him the ogres shrieked
00:28:43.600 and dropped all of the plunder they were
00:28:45.399 carrying to escape into the center of
00:28:47.559 the
00:28:49.320 Fortress momotaro and his companions
00:28:52.240 went quickly after
00:28:55.519 them but just as they entered the inner
00:28:58.320 most Chamber Of The Fortress they saw
00:29:00.720 the last ogre disappear into a hole that
00:29:04.120 led to the bowels of the
00:29:05.880 [Music]
00:29:07.000 earth quickly momotaro gave the dog his
00:29:10.240 iron gunson and climbed in after them
00:29:14.200 while his friends waited
00:29:17.320 anxiously as they were waiting though a
00:29:20.480 great earthquake shook the entire Island
00:29:23.640 it was so powerful that the AP the dog
00:29:26.799 and the pheasant fell to the ground and
00:29:30.120 the Fortress around them began to
00:29:39.960 crumble when it had finally stopped they
00:29:43.440 were quiet for they were all convinced
00:29:46.799 that momotaro had met his end but just
00:29:50.320 as they were about to leave they heard a
00:29:52.679 noise coming from inside the
00:29:54.840 hole momotaro was alive
00:30:03.120 and as he emerged from the hole they saw
00:30:06.159 that he was followed by a huge train of
00:30:08.440 the ogres captives all the people who
00:30:11.559 had been stolen his children and held
00:30:14.320 prisoner all these
00:30:18.760 years when all the people had finally
00:30:21.240 come out momotaro picked up a huge Rock
00:30:25.279 and with it he sealed the entrance to
00:30:27.799 the bowels of the Earth
00:30:33.120 forever now because of the Great
00:30:35.679 Earthquake the Sulfur Springs around the
00:30:38.519 island had been instantly transformed
00:30:41.159 into gushing Fountains of water that
00:30:43.399 flowed
00:30:45.360 everywhere and now all of the soil that
00:30:48.240 had been formerly parched and cracked
00:30:50.840 erupted with trees and green plants and
00:30:56.919 flowers even the horrible smell of
00:30:59.480 sulfur and fear that was in the air
00:31:02.880 evaporated and was eclipsed by the
00:31:05.240 powerful and beautiful fragrance of
00:31:08.120 peach
00:31:09.990 [Music]
00:31:11.240 blossoms on seeing this everyone sang
00:31:14.720 out in
00:31:18.240 Joy then they marched back to momotaro's
00:31:21.039 ship with the ogre's plunder and
00:31:24.360 accompanied by the birds and the fish
00:31:28.440 and the whales and the leaping
00:31:31.720 Dolphins they began the long journey
00:31:35.760 home back into the Setting
00:31:41.750 [Music]
00:31:56.840 Sun

00:35:02.920 Brahman Ravi Shankar one of the most
00:35:05.800 famous musicians in India and in the
00:35:08.440 world he's also the person who composed
00:35:10.920 the music you'll hear in the story let's
00:35:13.400 join Robi as he teaches his daughter
00:35:15.359 Anushka to play the sitar and listen as
00:35:18.280 he tells how he became a master of this
00:35:20.839 musical
00:35:22.720 instrument my experience with music from
00:35:25.760 my childhood started in India where I
00:35:28.280 was
00:35:30.119 born it's one of the most exciting
00:35:32.800 places there's so much Sound and Music
00:35:36.800 and
00:35:39.640 fun at the age of 10 I was brought to
00:35:43.280 Paris by my brother UD who had become a
00:35:47.480 very famous
00:35:48.640 dancer that's where I started you know
00:35:51.319 playing sa flute da blah whatever I
00:35:55.119 could get my hand on you know and I had
00:35:57.640 had very good ear I could pick up
00:35:59.839 anything I heard I became seriously
00:36:03.280 involved with sitar after I met Baba
00:36:06.359 Aladin Khan this great musician joined
00:36:09.920 my brother's group in 1935 that's when I
00:36:13.599 was 15 he was the greatest musician of
00:36:16.440 that time he could play any instruments
00:36:19.960 and he started teaching
00:36:21.960 me that's something which changed my
00:36:24.319 life
00:36:26.560 completely
00:36:30.359 the SAT has been there in India for
00:36:32.640 almost 750 years it's made out of
00:36:36.560 special wood sometime tick sometime some
00:36:39.119 other wood it's completely hollow
00:36:42.319 inside and this round thing as you see
00:36:46.720 is is a
00:36:48.160 gold dry pumpkin you know but rest is
00:36:52.480 all wood all this design work you see
00:36:56.200 beautiful here
00:36:58.520 also basically we have four strings for
00:37:02.119 playing the
00:37:04.640 melody and two side strings for the
00:37:07.319 rhythm of the
00:37:09.720 Drone underneath there are underneath
00:37:13.000 all the strings and
00:37:14.880 Frets you have 13 strings which are the
00:37:18.880 resonating sympathetic strings and
00:37:21.800 sometime we strum on this uh like
00:37:26.520 this for special effect it takes many
00:37:30.319 years to learn the technique and then
00:37:33.319 the goal is to improvise therefore it
00:37:36.800 comes out always new and fresh whatever
00:37:39.560 we
00:37:40.770 [Music]
00:37:43.000 do when I first heard the story of the
00:37:46.680 tiger and the bramman it struck to me
00:37:49.839 that I know this story because it is
00:37:52.680 very much like all the stories I have
00:37:54.720 heard in my childhood and read it was
00:37:58.520 very spontaneous for me to do the music
00:38:01.680 it just clicked very quickly the sound
00:38:05.000 and the quality of Music I've always
00:38:08.599 felt like doing the simplest things not
00:38:11.119 very complex you know simple instruments
00:38:14.400 trying to give color for each different
00:38:17.880 characters and so I got very
00:38:21.280 inspired for the bramman himself I
00:38:24.920 immediately thought a sound that is full
00:38:27.920 of peace and
00:38:30.599 calm very pure
00:38:35.680 sounds so I chose the wooden bamboo
00:38:39.600 [Music]
00:38:47.400 flute for the tiger it was a different
00:38:50.560 thing it had to be something almost
00:38:54.160 violent but in the beginning he was very
00:38:57.440 subdued because he was in a
00:38:59.359 cage but I had to keep that heavy heart
00:39:02.760 sound in the
00:39:05.860 [Music]
00:39:08.200 background and finally The Jackal crafty
00:39:12.560 intelligent and also very wise basically
00:39:17.200 I use what we call kamak it's a string
00:39:20.119 which is pulled and it gives a very
00:39:22.400 funny sound
00:39:26.359 like
00:39:27.900 [Music]
00:39:30.040 so it really worked very well because I
00:39:32.240 just let myself go and felt the story
00:39:36.079 within me it made me very happy to do
00:39:39.119 music for
00:39:42.480 this I live mostly in California
00:39:48.520 nowadays and I live with just my wife
00:39:51.359 Suk and my daughter
00:39:54.079 Anushka I'm teaching Anushka and that's
00:39:57.920 a very great thing for me because at
00:40:00.359 this age I want to give her as much as I
00:40:03.560 can and pass on the tradition what I
00:40:07.000 have been blessed with
00:40:11.780 [Music]
00:40:23.440 yeah
00:40:25.240 yeah our music also also teaches lot of
00:40:29.480 things not just
00:40:32.079 entertainment but also a great
00:40:35.359 spiritual
00:40:39.710 [Music]
00:40:42.640 satisfaction Indian music is the most
00:40:45.960 complex system in the
00:40:48.560 world it can be so ageless Timeless I
00:40:52.319 think it works even
00:40:56.240 today we have lot of fun the three of
00:41:03.520 us I feel very happy this is a beautiful
00:41:08.839 place there are students from India who
00:41:11.560 come once in a while stay here and
00:41:15.040 learn but I'm happy with my

00:44:34.400 live or in India all things have a
00:44:41.110 [Music]
00:44:46.400 purpose there was once a wise and holy
00:44:49.280 man in India a
00:44:52.960 Brahman he was a good man who always
00:44:55.440 acquired Merit by performing helpful
00:44:57.200 Deeds for the people of his
00:45:00.079 village when a beggar asked for food the
00:45:03.599 Brahman gave food to the poor
00:45:05.680 [Music]
00:45:08.920 richet when two men quarreled the
00:45:11.880 Brahman made
00:45:17.319 peace when a villager required
00:45:19.839 counseling the Brahman consulted the
00:45:22.119 heavens and gave advice that rang
00:45:25.960 true
00:45:27.760 if you were to ask the Brahman why he
00:45:31.079 always performed Good Deeds he would
00:45:34.839 reply because that is my
00:45:38.079 duty my duty is to ease suffering
00:45:41.079 through
00:45:42.040 compassion it is my
00:45:44.359 responsibility to fulfill my
00:45:46.840 [Music]
00:45:50.960 duty the Brahman was a most remarkable
00:45:53.920 fellow bringing goodness and wisdom
00:45:56.319 wherever he went
00:45:59.020 [Music]
00:46:04.000 one day the Brahman heard sobbing from
00:46:06.599 under the shadow of a mango
00:46:08.559 tree he went to see who it was that
00:46:14.760 cried the Brahman was astonished to
00:46:17.520 discover a tiger trapped in a
00:46:21.280 cage the tiger wailed in the presence of
00:46:24.079 the
00:46:25.200 Brahman oh help me Holy One please let
00:46:30.839 me out of the cage brahin bapu if you
00:46:34.319 don't I shall be killed and skinned for
00:46:37.040 some sahib's
00:46:40.079 rug now the Tiger's request presented a
00:46:43.800 most curious problem for the Brahman you
00:46:46.760 see according to His holy Scriptures it
00:46:50.359 was his duty to practice charity to All
00:46:53.359 Things Great and Small but if he freed
00:46:57.119 the tiger from the cage the Brahman
00:46:59.520 might very well become the Tiger's
00:47:02.839 dinner tiger said the
00:47:06.240 Brahman I would very much like to help
00:47:10.160 thee however if I do such a thing I'm
00:47:12.880 liable to be
00:47:14.240 eaten all of India knows that the Tiger
00:47:17.079 has a most voracious
00:47:19.040 appetite I give you assurances cried the
00:47:22.400 tiger I Shan eat you if you let me out
00:47:25.559 of the cage I shall repay your kindness
00:47:28.000 with gratitude I swear to Vishnu that I
00:47:31.640 won't eat
00:47:37.960 you the Brahman hesitated for a
00:47:44.000 moment tiger appears most righteous
00:47:47.200 thought the Brahman he is in Dire
00:47:50.119 Straits and I must assist
00:47:53.839 him tiger said the Brahman
00:47:57.839 the hand of friendship shall avert the
00:48:00.440 cage of Calamity I shall set you
00:48:06.800 free with that the Brahman opened the
00:48:09.960 door to the
00:48:11.960 cage the tiger immediately bounded out
00:48:14.880 of his confinement and pounced on the
00:48:16.960 unsuspecting
00:48:18.520 Brahman he quickly wrestled the holy man
00:48:21.040 to the ground and took hold of his
00:48:24.240 throat what a fool Thou Art Brahman he
00:48:27.720 roared loudly you believed that Dil
00:48:30.960 about repaying your kindness with my
00:48:33.000 gratitude even an imal knows that the
00:48:35.760 tiger never lets his dinner walk
00:48:39.160 away the Brahman was
00:48:42.599 petrified mine end is here he
00:48:47.040 thought oh tiger said the Brahman I was
00:48:50.920 kind enough to give you your freedom
00:48:53.359 thou repays my freedom thus surely this
00:48:57.599 is not a just
00:48:59.080 [Music]
00:49:01.119 reward what would you have me do replied
00:49:04.119 the tiger it is my duty to soop on your
00:49:07.440 bones do you expect me to forget my
00:49:09.920 appetite because it is not
00:49:12.680 just in a manner of speaking yes the
00:49:15.960 Brahman said with a
00:49:17.680 shiver Brahman you are more foolish than
00:49:20.880 I thought said the tiger it is not the
00:49:24.880 way of the world
00:49:27.960 but I shall give you a chance continued
00:49:30.240 the tiger go from here and ask the first
00:49:34.000 three things you meet what I should do
00:49:35.720 with you then return to me with the
00:49:38.040 answers and I will follow the
00:49:41.480 advice so the tiger set the Brahman
00:49:44.760 free as the Brahman shook the dust from
00:49:47.280 his robe the tiger warned him remember
00:49:51.960 the first three things you meet and
00:49:55.119 return quickly for I am getting hungrier
00:49:57.359 by the minute do not make me come
00:50:00.000 searching for
00:50:02.780 [Music]
00:50:10.880 you now the Brahman was certain that his
00:50:14.040 Good Deed would not end in his being
00:50:16.119 eaten it would not be
00:50:17.970 [Music]
00:50:21.720 just so he set his face Serene and
00:50:25.079 untroubled towards the task at
00:50:28.040 [Music]
00:50:33.119 hand the first thing he met was an
00:50:37.020 [Music]
00:50:41.319 elephant obeying the Tiger's command to
00:50:43.880 the letter he told the elephant of his
00:50:47.359 ordal I heard the tiger wailing under
00:50:50.839 the mango tree and he asked me to free
00:50:53.280 him he promised me that he would not eat
00:50:55.960 me but when I freed him he wanted to eat
00:51:00.799 me tell me then asked the Brahman do
00:51:04.400 thou think the tiger ought to eat
00:51:10.119 me since I was a
00:51:12.920 car my master has bound me with this
00:51:16.599 iron ring around my
00:51:18.760 leg said the
00:51:21.280 elephant I can go nowhere I want because
00:51:24.720 he keeps me chained
00:51:28.160 when my master rides me he beats my back
00:51:31.400 with a
00:51:32.720 cane so that I will walk
00:51:36.200 faster I am a miserable servant to his
00:51:40.240 every
00:51:41.280 order I I am sorry for your servitude
00:51:43.799 elephant said the Brahman however my
00:51:46.400 question was what does thou think the
00:51:48.640 tiger should do with
00:51:50.559 me is it not plain to you what I think
00:51:54.119 said the elephant we must obey the
00:51:57.640 orders of our
00:52:00.079 masters the tiger is your
00:52:04.599 master face your
00:52:06.799 fate and
00:52:08.839 be
00:52:14.319 eaten the elephant's answer deeply
00:52:16.559 troubled the Brahman and made him sad of
00:52:21.830 [Music]
00:52:25.520 heart
00:52:28.200 surely pity and compassion must exist in
00:52:32.000 this world said the
00:52:35.359 Brahman so he continued to
00:52:37.820 [Music]
00:52:47.599 walk the next thing the Brahman
00:52:49.599 encountered was the peot
00:52:51.600 [Music]
00:52:55.440 tree the Brahman told the pil tree his
00:52:59.880 story tell me asked the Brahman Dost
00:53:03.240 thou think the tiger ought to eat
00:53:05.960 me what have you to complain about
00:53:09.000 Brahman replied the pil tree I give
00:53:12.559 shade and shelter to everyone who passes
00:53:14.839 by and what kind of gratitude do they
00:53:16.880 show me they tear down my branches to
00:53:18.799 feed their cattle I am appalled by the
00:53:22.440 way Thou Art abused said the Brahman but
00:53:25.200 what about my predicament
00:53:27.720 don't whimper admonished the P tree be a
00:53:31.480 man go back to the tiger the world is a
00:53:34.119 cruel
00:53:35.480 [Music]
00:53:45.520 place the Brahman was astonished by the
00:53:48.440 pil tre's point of view he he grew
00:53:50.480 greatly
00:53:53.599 saddened but all was not lost
00:54:00.160 he saw a water buffalo in a field
00:54:02.520 turning the wheel for a
00:54:04.860 [Music]
00:54:07.440 well the Brahman told the water buffalo
00:54:10.920 his
00:54:11.839 story tell me asked the Brahman Dost
00:54:15.319 thou think the tiger ought to eat me you
00:54:19.280 are a fool to expect gratitude said the
00:54:21.520 water buffalo look at me in my life when
00:54:25.240 I once gave milk they let me a tender
00:54:27.160 cotton seed and delicious oil cake but
00:54:30.040 now that I'm dry they yoke me here and
00:54:32.040 give me garbage to eat is that
00:54:34.040 gratitude there's no gratitude in this
00:54:36.240 world go to your tiger in his Jaws await
00:54:39.839 his only gratitude for you
00:54:42.770 [Music]
00:54:47.960 Brahman the Brahman left the water
00:54:50.720 buffalo and began his journey back to
00:54:52.559 the
00:54:55.319 Tiger
00:54:58.950 [Music]
00:55:02.200 the first three things he saw testified
00:55:04.359 that he was to be the Tiger's dinner his
00:55:07.200 fate had been
00:55:08.480 [Music]
00:55:13.000 decided surely his life had been for not
00:55:16.160 the Brahman thought as he
00:55:20.680 [Music]
00:55:23.200 walked he had spent his many years doing
00:55:26.079 good good turns for the people in his
00:55:27.760 village bestowing charity on All Things
00:55:30.039 Great and Small he studied the holy
00:55:32.760 books of India and extracted
00:55:38.280 meaning what a fool he had been to think
00:55:41.119 that he was a wise man and understood
00:55:43.440 the ways of the
00:55:50.640 world I'm nothing more than the Tiger's
00:55:53.640 dinner said the Brahman with pain and S
00:55:56.280 offering in his voice excuse me Holy One
00:56:00.039 said a voice from behind the
00:56:02.160 Brahman what is this you speak about you
00:56:04.599 want to eat a tiger for dinner the
00:56:07.200 Brahman turned to see who it was that
00:56:08.680 spoke to him there he saw Jackal no said
00:56:13.039 the Brahman I do not want to eat the
00:56:15.520 tiger for dinner the tiger will eat me
00:56:17.960 for
00:56:19.000 dinner but that is strange said the
00:56:21.559 Jackal does not the tiger know that the
00:56:24.160 meat of the holy men is always is tough
00:56:27.359 and full of
00:56:28.880 gristle that is beside the point the
00:56:31.319 Brahman said sadly I freed the tiger
00:56:34.480 from a cage and now he wants to eat
00:56:37.440 me that is most
00:56:42.039 problematical said the Jackal but uh
00:56:45.760 tell me Holy One why did you free him
00:56:48.480 from the
00:56:49.599 cage the Brahman was getting we of this
00:56:52.440 Jackal and all his
00:56:54.319 questions before I let the the tiger out
00:56:56.920 of the cage he promised that he would
00:56:59.200 not eat me said the
00:57:01.480 Brahman Brahman Buu said the Jackal
00:57:04.520 scratching his
00:57:06.000 head this is most confusing to me I must
00:57:09.280 sit down and decipher this canundrum The
00:57:13.160 Jackal sat on the road to
00:57:18.520 think he crossed his legs and put his
00:57:20.920 chin in his
00:57:22.600 [Music]
00:57:25.160 paws
00:57:27.400 he grew deep in
00:57:29.170 [Music]
00:57:31.039 thought suddenly a look of confusion
00:57:33.760 overcame the jackal's
00:57:35.480 face pardon me Holy One said the
00:57:39.520 Jackal this is quite perplexing would
00:57:42.160 you mind explaining it to me once again
00:57:45.319 so the Brahman again told the story of
00:57:47.319 the Tiger in the cage and now he freed
00:57:49.559 the Beast and when he came to the part
00:57:51.760 where the tiger wanted to eat him the
00:57:54.039 Jackal shrieked yeah ow there it goes
00:57:58.079 again cried the Jackal I simply can't
00:58:01.760 understand uh the story seems to go in
00:58:04.640 one of my ears and out the other uh I
00:58:08.799 have decided said the Jackal take me to
00:58:12.200 the place where this most unfortunate
00:58:14.640 event occurred I will better understand
00:58:17.280 it
00:58:18.200 there and so the Brahman and the Jackal
00:58:21.520 went to the tiger who lay in front of
00:58:24.280 the cage sharpening his teeth and
00:58:28.039 Claws it is about time Brahman the tiger
00:58:31.839 roared you have kept me waiting for our
00:58:35.119 dinner our dinner said the Brahman as
00:58:38.960 his knees knocked together and his teeth
00:58:41.440 chattered it is the most delicate way
00:58:43.720 you have spoke it come Brahman growled
00:58:47.039 the tiger let us begin
00:58:49.680 eating uh one moment please said the
00:58:53.240 Brahman we have a most curious visitor
00:58:56.640 who insists on certain
00:58:58.960 knowledge quite frankly his persistence
00:59:01.200 is getting under my skin it seems that
00:59:04.319 I've explained my situation to him and
00:59:06.599 he is unable to understand said the
00:59:08.920 Brahman so before our dinner I thought I
00:59:12.960 could better show him with you and the
00:59:15.000 cage before us the Brahman went to the
00:59:17.520 tiger and whispered this will not take
00:59:20.240 long The Jackal is dimwitted and
00:59:23.559 certainly it would not be just to brush
00:59:26.599 him
00:59:30.839 aside the tiger groaned and begrudgingly
00:59:33.720 consented to the
00:59:36.200 request so the Brahman began to tell the
00:59:39.079 story once
00:59:40.160 again the Brahman did not miss a single
00:59:42.760 detail spinning the very longest of
00:59:45.400 Yarns oh my poor brain squealed The
00:59:49.079 Jackal squeezing his head with his paws
00:59:52.640 oh my poor brain I simply cannot
00:59:55.480 understand the particular particulars of
00:59:56.520 this
00:59:57.680 tale tiger rolled his eyes back into his
01:00:00.520 head surely this Jackal lacks cleverness
01:00:03.920 the tiger thought let me see if I have
01:00:07.119 this correctly continued The Jackal The
01:00:09.839 Brahman was in the cage and the tiger
01:00:13.440 came walking by no you fool roared the
01:00:19.119 tiger I was in the cage is your head
01:00:22.520 filled with camel
01:00:24.440 dong yes I am said the Jackal trembling
01:00:27.920 with fright I have a most tremendous
01:00:30.440 amount of camel dung in my head now I
01:00:33.400 think I understand the story so the
01:00:36.880 Jackal continued with yet another
01:00:39.000 version of the tale H tiger and the
01:00:42.319 Brahmin are in the casage
01:00:45.760 together and the tiger comes walking by
01:00:48.720 Ah that's so no wait how can the tiger
01:00:51.039 be in the cage and outside the cage at
01:00:53.200 the same time one cannot occupy two
01:00:55.119 places in space simultaneously surely
01:00:58.079 that is
01:01:00.319 axiomatic tiger was getting angrier by
01:01:03.240 the second clearly this Jackal was a
01:01:06.319 lunatic and he was delaying the Tiger's
01:01:09.160 dinner you idiot Bell the tiger how can
01:01:13.880 you be so stupid Jackal don't mind me
01:01:18.480 sir said the Jackal to the tiger begin
01:01:21.160 your dinner for I I I shall never
01:01:23.920 understand yes you will
01:01:27.079 understand the tiger raged I will make
01:01:30.920 you understand look here at me
01:01:37.119 I am the
01:01:41.160 tiger yes
01:01:42.960 sir and
01:01:45.440 that is the
01:01:48.680 cage yes S I was in the cage said the
01:01:54.640 tiger um
01:01:56.520 understand yes sir I I mean no sir I
01:01:59.520 mean I mean what do you mean sir I
01:02:03.160 mean I was in the cage said the
01:02:08.520 tiger ah but how did you get in the cage
01:02:11.880 asked the Jackal why the usual way of
01:02:15.240 course hollered the tiger oh it is my
01:02:18.680 head again well the Jackal I just cannot
01:02:21.720 seem to understand it please do not be
01:02:23.799 angry with me S just answer
01:02:26.359 what is the usual
01:02:28.240 way the tiger had finally lost what
01:02:31.720 little patience he possessed so he
01:02:34.359 jumped into the cage and declared this
01:02:37.599 way you
01:02:39.240 fool now you understand now perfectly
01:02:44.319 said the Jackal and no sooner had the
01:02:46.480 word left his mouth than the Jackal shut
01:02:48.640 the door of the cage trapping the tiger
01:02:51.319 once again now said the Jackal to the
01:02:54.680 Brahman if if you permit me to say so I
01:02:58.119 think we shall leave the Tiger in the
01:03:00.079 cage this time the Brahman looked on in
01:03:04.200 all free me at once ordered the tiger
01:03:07.839 you cannot leave me here holy one I have
01:03:12.520 pity for you tiger said the Brahman
01:03:15.920 perhaps when you are a sahib's rug you
01:03:19.119 will learn
