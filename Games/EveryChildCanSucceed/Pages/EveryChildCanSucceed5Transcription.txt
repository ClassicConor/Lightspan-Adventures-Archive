00:01:09.360 good morning boys and girls
00:01:14.560 i want to welcome you to van spirit day
00:01:18.640 you've so often heard me say that i'm
00:01:21.119 very proud to be the principal of van
00:01:23.439 school
00:01:24.720 because to me van school is very special
00:01:28.720 we have three special ingredients
00:01:32.240 we have tremendous students
00:01:35.360 terrific teachers and outstanding
00:01:38.560 parents
00:01:40.720 therefore
00:01:42.000 with those three ingredients banned
00:01:44.560 school really is the greatest school on
00:01:47.759 earth
00:01:49.780 
00:02:15.599 van school is part of the pittsburgh
00:02:18.000 public school system
00:02:20.080 you can almost see it from here located
00:02:22.560 just beyond those buildings in a part of
00:02:24.560 town known as the hill district
00:02:27.280 the hill district is a densely populated
00:02:29.680 urban area
00:02:31.680 like many inner city neighborhoods in
00:02:33.440 america
00:02:34.560 the hill district is mostly
00:02:36.000 african-american and mostly impoverished
00:02:39.040 with a reputation for crime-ridden
00:02:40.959 neighborhoods substandard housing
00:02:44.160 and dysfunctional schools
00:02:48.000 situated less than a quarter mile down
00:02:49.760 the hill from van is another elementary
00:02:51.840 school
00:02:53.120 it's the kind of school we expect to
00:02:54.800 find in surroundings like these a school
00:02:57.440 with low achievement scores
00:03:00.159 the robert l van elementary school
00:03:02.480 however has a much different record
00:03:05.440 year after year for more than 20 years
00:03:07.599 running
00:03:08.560 bans math and reading scores have placed
00:03:11.280 it at or near the top of pittsburgh's
00:03:13.760 public schools
00:03:15.920 demographic differences don't account
00:03:17.599 for the difference in achievement
00:03:18.879 between the schools
00:03:20.560 they both serve the same student
00:03:22.080 population drawn from virtually the same
00:03:24.799 projects and neighborhoods
00:03:28.000 well happy birthday nor can we dismiss
00:03:30.640 van's history of success as an anomaly
00:03:34.319 just a short distance away madison
00:03:36.640 elementary school has consciously
00:03:38.239 modeled itself on van
00:03:40.239 and in recent years has regularly
00:03:42.159 matched or surpassed its sister school
00:03:44.720 on measures of academic achievement
00:03:48.190 
00:03:53.420 
00:03:54.720 
00:03:57.120 why should one school consistently
00:03:59.120 succeed
00:04:00.400 where another serving the same
00:04:02.080 population in the same geographic locale
00:04:04.799 consistently failed
00:04:06.720 okay something that makes you laugh and
00:04:09.439 what you know just said taken by
00:04:11.840 surprise is one way that a writer can
00:04:16.079 make his story humorous do you remember
00:04:18.798 according to the parents teachers and
00:04:20.720 students of van's school the formula for
00:04:22.880 success is simple prize or something
00:04:25.240 unexpected
00:04:26.960 good teaching in an atmosphere conducive
00:04:29.440 to learning
00:04:31.040 poor doris brevard principal at van
00:04:33.360 school
00:04:34.240 that formula begins with a clear routine
00:04:36.880 and with discipline if you
00:04:39.840 are disciplined
00:04:41.759 then
00:04:42.639 you're here to learn you want to learn
00:04:45.520 and it's so very easy
00:04:47.440 to be taught if you have discipline
00:04:55.440 the majority of the children in the van
00:04:57.520 area
00:04:58.560 come from a single parent home
00:05:03.199 90 of our children are on free lunch
00:05:05.919 which means
00:05:07.120 the household receives assistance
00:05:12.880 we try to make the atmosphere and the
00:05:16.000 school conducive to learning however we
00:05:18.479 don't want it to be oppressive
00:05:21.520 we develop a routine for them because
00:05:25.280 outside of school
00:05:26.880 there's no routine
00:05:28.800 and we feel that a routine is important
00:05:31.600 for them to establish within the school
00:05:34.240 building
00:05:35.900 
00:05:39.759 the single parent home of course is so
00:05:42.800 interested in survival they can't
00:05:45.759 devote too much time to
00:05:47.919 the home situation or to the education
00:05:50.800 of the child therefore we have to meet
00:05:53.120 those needs when they come here within
00:05:54.800 the building
00:05:57.039 i expect the children
00:05:59.039 that come into van to respect the adults
00:06:03.600 but i also want them to respect
00:06:05.840 themselves
00:06:08.720 i expect the children to do their very
00:06:10.800 best
00:06:11.919 in every written assignment
00:06:14.240 and every test
00:06:15.759 and every recitation
00:06:17.520 i expect the very best water that's
00:06:21.039 white
00:06:22.000 what's the first sound you hear
00:06:25.919 what's the spelling
00:06:27.759 a successful school is a school
00:06:31.199 within which a child is totally educated
00:06:36.160 blind
00:06:38.639 what's it now what's the next time
00:06:40.319 you're here and every child meets his or
00:06:42.960 her potential
00:06:45.199 which eye is it
00:06:47.600 put it down not all children are going
00:06:49.759 to be a students or b students even but
00:06:53.599 if you're a good c student then your
00:06:56.400 accomplishments should be at the c level
00:06:58.319 you're going ahead of me erase your d
00:07:01.120 we're missing a sound
00:07:04.400 we're going to do this step by step
00:07:06.400 we're going to get it right
00:07:08.560 okay listen eugene
00:07:11.199 lie the teacher keeps a constant check
00:07:14.800 on the progress of the children
00:07:17.680 and i rely on his or her
00:07:21.199 definition of whether or not the child
00:07:23.280 has succeeded
00:07:24.720 tell me
00:07:29.039 great job i knew you could do it
00:07:31.440 very good
00:07:33.759 you don't want to send them on not
00:07:35.360 prepared right
00:07:36.639 that's going to be disastrous
00:07:39.599 we feel here if you can solve the
00:07:42.319 problems if you can get the children
00:07:44.080 help
00:07:44.960 at a very young age then that will
00:07:47.840 eliminate more serious problems when
00:07:50.319 they get older
00:07:51.599 that's why we stress
00:07:53.520 in the beginning
00:07:54.960 of the reading instruction that the
00:07:56.720 children master
00:07:58.479 whatever is being taught before they
00:08:00.400 move on
00:08:03.280 it's a red balloon with white and purple
00:08:06.720 stripes perfect for so many years you
00:08:09.599 heard constantly that the
00:08:11.400 african-american child could not learn
00:08:15.520 and it was our aim here to prove that
00:08:18.639 the african-american child could achieve
00:08:21.120 just as well as any other child
00:08:27.280 we don't have any hidden secrets three
00:08:29.840 cards for each we're just using the
00:08:31.759 curriculum
00:08:33.200 that's provided by the board
00:08:35.519 but our secret is we meet the needs of
00:08:37.679 our children
00:08:39.120 all right the first thing we're going to
00:08:40.719 do today is
00:08:42.559 go over our cards let's do the sounds
00:08:46.160 first is everyone watching
00:08:50.800 sound
00:08:52.720 sounds
00:08:57.440 reading using the open court phonetic
00:08:59.360 method
00:09:00.640 their enthusiasm for the method stems
00:09:03.279 from the fact that it seems to meet the
00:09:04.880 particular needs of van school students
00:09:08.080 first grade teacher gloria mathis
00:09:10.080 explains
00:09:12.080 the open court is
00:09:13.760 phonetic
00:09:14.880 and i love it
00:09:16.160 because
00:09:17.279 they're not just learning words they're
00:09:19.279 not just memorizing they're learning
00:09:21.680 sounds very good i like the way you did
00:09:24.160 those songs let's do the names now
00:09:26.240 what's the name of this card
00:09:27.810 
00:09:29.200 everyone works together
00:09:31.600 if you have someone who's a little bit
00:09:32.880 quicker than someone else kind of pulls
00:09:34.720 the group along and if someone's not
00:09:36.160 quite catching on it gives them a chance
00:09:38.800 to see what's going on through one of
00:09:41.200 their peers
00:09:42.480 what's the name of this card
00:09:44.640 teachers on the primary team work
00:09:46.640 closely together to determine what works
00:09:49.200 and what doesn't
00:09:51.200 their common goal is to lay the
00:09:52.800 foundations for academic success
00:09:55.440 they consciously strive to preserve a
00:09:57.360 structured
00:09:58.480 disciplined classroom that nonetheless
00:10:01.120 reflects warmth friendliness and
00:10:03.120 enthusiasm
00:10:05.600 i love teaching
00:10:07.200 i love being in the classroom
00:10:09.600 this is my heart i wouldn't be anywhere
00:10:12.000 else and i enjoy
00:10:13.839 working with the younger children
00:10:15.279 because you get the opportunity
00:10:17.600 to reach them when they're just starting
00:10:19.600 out their minds are open and they're
00:10:21.760 willing to
00:10:23.200 just accept and you can watch them grow
00:10:27.839 oh i like the way you did that did you
00:10:30.320 see the way veronica did that she put
00:10:32.720 her eye blank in and then she remembered
00:10:35.920 to go back and put her endings down on
00:10:38.240 the blank good job monika
00:10:41.680 marcus
00:10:44.480 line
00:10:45.680 three
00:10:46.560 the second
00:10:47.920 blank
00:10:51.120 the word is
00:10:53.279 leaf
00:10:55.519 leaf
00:10:57.440 the primary team's purpose is to ensure
00:10:59.519 success
00:11:00.880 even if that means holding back students
00:11:03.040 until they're ready to move on
00:11:05.600 look at the sound
00:11:07.200 this is a person nadine digger teaches
00:11:10.240 the early learning skills program else
00:11:22.560 ah carpenter fixes houses
00:11:25.839 who is it steven mckinnon good for you
00:11:29.839 mechanic the els program stands for
00:11:32.560 early learning skills
00:11:34.959 and
00:11:35.920 it's really a transition period between
00:11:38.240 the kindergarten and the more formalized
00:11:40.399 first grade
00:11:41.680 most of the children who come through
00:11:43.200 the early learning skills program have
00:11:45.760 been in kindergarten for a year
00:11:48.000 and for various reasons they were not
00:11:50.320 ready to go on to the formal first grade
00:11:53.839 sometimes it's immaturity
00:11:55.760 sometimes it's a minor
00:11:58.399 learning disability that with one extra
00:12:01.200 year getting the basic skills they can
00:12:03.600 go on then to be
00:12:05.200 a successful student in the first grade
00:12:11.440 there are some skills that we
00:12:13.680 have to repeat a lot
00:12:15.440 so i'm always looking for different ways
00:12:17.920 to work on the same skills that the
00:12:19.839 motivational level of the children stays
00:12:22.160 high
00:12:25.680 on her own time and with her husband's
00:12:27.920 help
00:12:29.040 mrs digger has created a series of
00:12:31.120 computer-based lessons to enhance the
00:12:33.600 learning experience for her els pupils
00:12:37.120 the programs provide a creative way to
00:12:39.200 teach repetitive material
00:12:42.000 academically we think it's working well
00:12:45.040 but probably the most interesting part
00:12:47.360 has been the self-confidence that it's
00:12:50.240 building in the children because for
00:12:52.240 some reason
00:12:53.440 being able to work a computer makes them
00:12:55.120 feel like like they are really special
00:12:57.440 people you hear a
00:12:59.200 at the end of the word
00:13:01.519 mrs brevard regularly monitors classroom
00:13:04.560 performance to ensure that achievement
00:13:06.720 and learning remains the primary goal of
00:13:08.720 all classroom activities
00:13:12.639 you have to be interested in children
00:13:14.399 you have to want to teach
00:13:16.880 sound you're not interested in just the
00:13:19.279 paycheck
00:13:20.800 okay
00:13:21.839 if something is the same
00:13:24.240 what do you think shaniqua you're
00:13:26.079 interested in achievement
00:13:29.440 the principal must provide the
00:13:31.519 atmosphere
00:13:35.440 and then it's the teacher's job to teach
00:13:38.800 but if that teacher can go into
00:13:41.199 his or her classroom and teach
00:13:43.680 35 minutes of the 40-minute period
00:13:46.800 then something will be accomplished
00:13:53.120 how would you cook a turkey
00:13:56.560 cut it up and then what do you do with
00:13:58.160 it
00:13:58.800 i find the most successful way that i
00:14:02.000 can monitor teachers is very informal by
00:14:05.760 going into the classroom participating
00:14:08.079 in the class pumpkin and grapes my
00:14:10.720 favorite apples
00:14:12.560 i'm interested in the response of the
00:14:15.040 children i'm looking forward to a letter
00:14:17.199 from you using cursive writing
00:14:20.399 if they're doing written work
00:14:22.880 i check the written work to be sure that
00:14:24.959 it is correct that it is
00:14:27.040 the best that they can do that's nice
00:14:30.639 mrs brevard sets
00:14:32.639 an outstanding tone for the building
00:14:35.760 she
00:14:36.720 establishes her expectations and we know
00:14:39.600 that when we come here there are high
00:14:41.760 expectations for both students and
00:14:44.000 teachers
00:14:45.519 and we rise to the occasion have you all
00:14:48.079 come for supper
00:14:50.639 and the bad baby said
00:14:52.720 teacher kathy gallagher is also the van
00:14:55.360 school librarian
00:14:57.360 ms gallagher's enthusiasm reinforces
00:14:59.680 learning and draws students like these
00:15:01.920 first graders into the magic of reading
00:15:04.000 everyone
00:15:05.519 and then the elephant went
00:15:15.440 my main
00:15:16.560 goal would be to teach them to love to
00:15:18.639 read
00:15:19.440 to make them lifetime readers and the
00:15:21.519 lady from the candy store and the fruit
00:15:23.440 and vegetable me and all running after
00:15:26.880 but the bad baby went right to sleep
00:15:32.800 right that was good
00:15:35.279 thank you
00:15:36.560 thank you for helping
00:15:38.560 all right we have two parts to a
00:15:40.959 sentence
00:15:41.920 we have
00:15:43.920 naming part
00:15:47.279 you have to have both of these to make a
00:15:49.759 complete sentence now i have some cards
00:15:52.480 but they are not sentences yet they are
00:15:54.639 only parts of the sentence and i need
00:15:56.880 someone to come up and read one of these
00:15:58.880 cards and tell me whether it should go
00:16:00.639 in the naming part or in the telling
00:16:02.720 part
00:16:03.920 marita maloney continues to accentuate
00:16:06.399 the basics providing students with the
00:16:08.800 tools they will need to succeed in the
00:16:10.560 higher grades
00:16:13.260 
00:16:14.560 i wonder if that's a naming part or a
00:16:16.720 telling part
00:16:18.240 cement
00:16:19.839 good would you put that in the naming
00:16:21.360 bag please
00:16:23.360 good i have another one here children
00:16:25.279 who leave the primary grades advan
00:16:27.920 leave with a sense of achievement
00:16:29.759 success and self-confidence what does it
00:16:32.560 say
00:16:33.759 in every class at band school there is a
00:16:36.240 conscious effort to reinforce a positive
00:16:38.480 self image
00:16:40.320 look like you're happy that's what you
00:16:42.240 have to look like on friday that's a pep
00:16:44.399 assembly
00:16:48.320 achievement
00:16:49.600 doing one's best is stress throughout
00:16:52.399 the curriculum
00:16:53.170 
00:16:57.279 so often the african-american child
00:17:00.480 has a defeatist attitude
00:17:02.959 therefore we stress that they are
00:17:04.880 important that they can succeed
00:17:07.919 that they are somebody and they can't be
00:17:10.400 somebody
00:17:12.559 and that's something that you have to
00:17:14.160 teach every day in every lesson
00:17:17.490 
00:17:30.390 
00:17:52.559 uh
00:17:54.540 
00:18:03.170 
00:18:04.910 
00:18:05.020 
00:18:07.500 
00:18:13.920 
00:18:19.360 performance is what puts van students on
00:18:21.840 top on the primary grades
00:18:25.520 but how is this high level of
00:18:26.880 achievement sustained in grades 3 4 and
00:18:29.600 5.
00:18:30.799 anything else a writer can do to make a
00:18:32.559 story humorous amber mrs lipsman's fifth
00:18:35.440 grade reading class shows how van's
00:18:37.440 students rise to the challenge
00:18:40.720 pun that's right perfect all right i
00:18:43.440 really believe that it's a question of
00:18:45.679 high expectations more than anything
00:18:47.600 else
00:18:49.280 we have teachers who are actively
00:18:51.520 involved
00:18:52.799 with the students who have students
00:18:55.360 actively involved with the learning
00:18:56.960 process but if we look for two things we
00:19:00.640 really get a summary what do i ask for
00:19:03.440 i think one of the things that makes us
00:19:05.200 very special
00:19:06.480 is that we are consistent in terms of
00:19:08.880 what we expect from our children
00:19:11.520 problem is consistent from grades
00:19:13.919 kindergarten through grades five and
00:19:16.720 i want obviously
00:19:19.760 jamie
00:19:22.000 details that tell me how about
00:19:26.960 from the
00:19:28.480 solving right i always stress the fact
00:19:31.760 that the success that van has achieved
00:19:36.080 is really because of the teaching
00:19:38.880 because if we didn't have successful
00:19:41.120 teaching of course we would not have the
00:19:42.880 good scores and the good accomplishments
00:19:47.039 the next building has three apartments
00:19:50.160 these doors are the apartment doors
00:19:52.559 are there
00:19:54.320 vans students consistently rank at the
00:19:56.480 top of the pittsburgh public school
00:19:58.160 system how many how many apartments in
00:20:00.400 the whole complex
00:20:02.320 well okay so we're working on numbers up
00:20:05.039 to 12 digits
00:20:06.480 what puts van's math scores on top is
00:20:09.360 good solid teaching at the hands of
00:20:11.440 experienced professionals like eileen
00:20:14.000 fabric in this fifth grade math class
00:20:16.159 ten times larger
00:20:18.480 than the apartment to its right
00:20:21.200 so the tens is ten times larger than the
00:20:23.679 ones
00:20:24.640 the hundreds is ten times larger than
00:20:26.799 the tens
00:20:27.919 the thousands i think the high scores
00:20:30.240 are attributed to
00:20:31.840 the children's motivation they're highly
00:20:34.799 motivated in math
00:20:36.799 they want to do well they want to they
00:20:39.360 know they can and they they want to
00:20:41.440 succeed all right i'm going to ask you a
00:20:43.039 different kind of question now
00:20:48.000 which number is in the hundred billions
00:20:51.760 place and what is the value of it
00:20:54.799 hundred billion
00:20:57.280 nathan
00:20:59.280 five and what's the value of that
00:21:01.120 thought
00:21:02.400 500 billion 500 billion can you write it
00:21:05.360 yes
00:21:06.720 you got to try save somebody without
00:21:08.960 looking at this stuff
00:21:12.320 i hope i'm laying a strong foundation
00:21:14.880 for them in later life
00:21:17.760 hoping to prepare them for middle school
00:21:20.320 eventually for a secondary school
00:21:22.799 concentrate on what you told me said 500
00:21:25.360 billion
00:21:26.640 and ultimately for a lifetime
00:21:39.919 is he correct yes very good very good
00:21:44.400 math lessons are reinforced by practical
00:21:46.480 experience
00:21:47.760 here
00:21:48.640 miss fabric helps the children learn how
00:21:50.559 to maintain their own savings accounts
00:21:52.480 at a neighborhood bank
00:21:54.559 this type of involvement is part of ms
00:21:56.720 fabric's teaching style
00:21:59.600 picture yesterday instead of a small one
00:22:01.360 what else was different ms gallagher's
00:22:03.440 emphasis on active dialogue with her
00:22:05.520 students like these fourth graders is
00:22:07.679 the key element in her teaching style
00:22:09.600 same picture yesterday so like carmen
00:22:12.240 said we really had some mystery to it
00:22:15.360 and i think there should be some fun to
00:22:17.360 it
00:22:18.240 and i think that children
00:22:21.039 learn best when they're comfortable with
00:22:23.600 you i think you have to establish trust
00:22:26.640 and i think you need humor in the
00:22:28.559 classroom what else do we look for plot
00:22:31.200 plots oh my plot what is plot and i try
00:22:35.120 to incorporate all this
00:22:37.120 into my teaching the action of the drama
00:22:39.600 and the story the action or the drama in
00:22:41.840 the story great so we're going to look
00:22:43.360 for all of those things in everybody's
00:22:45.120 story
00:22:46.559 and why do we read other people's
00:22:48.400 stories why do we love them i want them
00:22:51.039 to be able to communicate
00:22:54.000 with the written word that's when you
00:22:55.760 move closer to the audience that we'll
00:22:57.120 be able to hear better thank you looking
00:22:59.520 at this guys once upon a time there were
00:23:02.960 three friends john in order for them to
00:23:05.120 do that i think they have to experience
00:23:08.559 many different types of writing
00:23:11.520 what's that said john
00:23:14.000 it gives them a chance to read their
00:23:15.440 story orally
00:23:17.520 it gives them a chance to hear each
00:23:19.520 other's stories
00:23:21.360 and it gives them a chance to understand
00:23:23.360 what someone else has put into their
00:23:24.799 story
00:23:25.919 so they kept the thing until it stopped
00:23:28.320 working
00:23:29.360 they never knew it
00:23:31.760 that it took batteries
00:23:35.340 
00:23:38.480 every child can learn every child can
00:23:40.799 succeed
00:23:41.840 and i think advan every child does
00:23:47.700 
00:23:49.039 spirit day at van school
00:23:52.480 at this assembly success is the only
00:23:54.720 item on the agenda
00:23:58.159 with awards to students for academic
00:24:00.159 excellence
00:24:05.279 for developing instructional computer
00:24:07.200 programs on their own time
00:24:09.279 a rose to mrs digga and her husband i'm
00:24:12.080 sure she'll extend our thanks and
00:24:14.080 appreciation to mrs to mr digger thank
00:24:17.200 you and special congratulations to a
00:24:20.240 student and his family on the child's
00:24:22.640 improved behavior and achievement
00:24:27.120 fifth grader dayron dedrick is a good
00:24:29.360 example of success at van school
00:24:32.400 deron is a good student who's also
00:24:34.880 emerged as a school leader this year
00:24:38.320 every day deyron his younger brother
00:24:40.559 kevin and their friend head for home
00:24:42.799 through the streets of the hill district
00:24:46.480 home for daeron is the projects
00:24:49.200 where retaining the values learned at
00:24:50.880 van requires a conscious choice
00:24:54.640 it helps that deyron and kevin have
00:24:56.640 strong parental support with both of
00:24:59.279 them i'm very very very pleased i think
00:25:02.559 that deron being an older brother
00:25:05.360 is setting a really good example for
00:25:08.080 kevin to follow
00:25:09.760 um
00:25:11.120 i think that van is a good school no
00:25:14.880 that's why you're cool ain't been
00:25:16.000 tasting like that they do a good job
00:25:18.080 with the children as far as discipline
00:25:20.880 and if you don't have those type of
00:25:23.200 teachers that they have
00:25:24.960 to push the kids to excel
00:25:27.600 and succeed and it would never happen
00:25:31.039 despite the fact that many van parents
00:25:33.200 are fully occupied in the struggle for
00:25:35.120 survival
00:25:36.320 the school has an active and supportive
00:25:38.640 pto this time for the afternoon
00:25:40.559 kindergarten too because we have a half
00:25:42.159 day mrs jenkins is this year's pto
00:25:44.880 president
00:25:46.080 her daughter leilani is in the second
00:25:47.919 grade
00:25:49.279 pto is there so we can help the kids
00:25:52.480 without the pto
00:25:54.159 they wouldn't have certain things that
00:25:56.159 they could get like field trip money or
00:25:59.279 maybe there's a field trip going to the
00:26:02.000 museum or or money funded for them just
00:26:05.360 to
00:26:06.000 get some books or something like that
00:26:08.799 pto activities like this treasure chest
00:26:11.679 which rewards weekly achievement help
00:26:14.159 make van a success
00:26:16.640 but parents don't hesitate to identify
00:26:18.640 the real key to van's success
00:26:22.320 mrs
00:26:23.840 she's what makes it work i see her as
00:26:26.240 being consistent
00:26:28.240 which is a key when you're dealing with
00:26:30.159 children
00:26:31.440 and she goes for no nonsense
00:26:33.760 you know she is in charge of her school
00:26:36.799 and no one else mrs brevard and the
00:26:39.520 wonderful staff that she has is what
00:26:42.159 makes van work
00:26:44.240 the grandparents might have just come
00:26:45.840 into the picture last spring maybe so
00:26:48.640 i've known mrs brevard for the entire 23
00:26:51.200 years that she's been a principal yes
00:26:52.799 because
00:26:53.600 and from the very beginning she has
00:26:55.279 indeed been a risk taker so he must have
00:26:57.520 come in
00:26:58.480 she is constantly
00:27:00.640 thinking and aware of what's good for
00:27:02.480 the kids advance
00:27:04.720 if central office comes out with a new
00:27:06.640 initiative or a new program and she does
00:27:09.520 not feel that it fits within our
00:27:11.120 philosophy or our framework
00:27:13.440 for these particular youngsters she'll
00:27:15.760 dismiss it and she won't allow it to be
00:27:18.080 part of our curriculum or our program
00:27:20.399 sufficient so we will increase by 10.
00:27:23.279 well i really think there's been too
00:27:24.960 much emphasis that the principle is the
00:27:28.159 most important element
00:27:30.880 whereas it is the teachers because if
00:27:33.200 the teachers really
00:27:34.720 aren't concerned about the school if
00:27:36.640 they really aren't dedicated
00:27:38.720 then regardless of what i do
00:27:41.360 whether i monitor them i don't care what
00:27:43.760 kind of atmosphere i produce
00:27:46.000 if they're not interested they're not
00:27:48.000 going to take or play their part
00:27:51.600 in the development of the school
00:27:54.320 my job is more or less to keep the
00:27:56.480 teachers interested to keep them
00:27:58.399 involved
00:28:01.039 and to let them know that i appreciate
00:28:03.840 what they've done
00:28:05.279 and i tell them that daily
00:28:07.850 
00:28:50.559 so




00:29:27.300 
00:29:32.799 walk into a classroom at the new suncook
00:29:35.200 school
00:29:36.080 you're never sure what you might find
00:29:39.039 students in large groups
00:29:41.039 in small groups
00:29:42.640 working alone
00:29:44.480 the word that comes to mind is chaos
00:29:48.640 what's happening do you think
00:29:50.880 the initial impression is that it it's
00:29:53.279 been that there's a lot of noise and
00:29:55.360 what is going on and it doesn't look
00:29:57.360 like school like when i went to school
00:30:00.559 then there are the hallways
00:30:02.720 used for reading instruction
00:30:05.279 and even singing
00:30:07.480 
00:30:14.159 but despite the noise despite the
00:30:16.559 apparent chaos this is a school with one
00:30:19.600 mission
00:30:20.480 to enable all students to become
00:30:23.039 lifelong learners
00:30:25.039 a what a what i think that some people
00:30:27.760 get hung up on the idea that the
00:30:29.600 structure is the important part of
00:30:32.000 what's happening and to me
00:30:34.320 what's most important is the interaction
00:30:36.799 between teacher and child
00:30:38.720 oh
00:30:39.679 what do you say oh wait a minute he's
00:30:41.520 not done yet
00:30:42.799 the atmosphere is unusual
00:30:45.279 so are the results
00:30:49.070 
00:30:50.720 yeah
00:30:52.080 the new suncook school is recognized as
00:30:54.320 a model of teaching
00:30:56.080 and a model of learning
00:30:59.850 
00:31:02.160 
00:31:23.690 
00:31:24.799 and for the latest weather across
00:31:26.080 western maine and the white mountains
00:31:27.679 over to level main and a good morning to
00:31:29.440 daina bean
00:31:30.720 today it should be mostly sunny
00:31:32.880 temperatures near 80. thursday another
00:31:35.679 sunny day
00:31:37.519 possibly reaching 90 degrees tomorrow
00:31:40.880 well jeff enjoy the little drink one day
00:31:43.600 you will look back and realized they
00:31:46.159 were the big things
00:31:48.159 have a good day jeff
00:31:49.840 dana bean gives his daily weather
00:31:51.679 forecast from this farmhouse right
00:31:54.000 across the street from one of the
00:31:55.519 highest achieving elementary schools in
00:31:57.600 maine
00:31:58.559 the new suncook school is located in the
00:32:00.880 town of laval main population 888.
00:32:05.600 it's in the rural western part of the
00:32:07.600 state an area of chronic unemployment
00:32:10.640 about one-third of the students are
00:32:12.480 eligible for free or reduced price lunch
00:32:15.919 despite its isolation and the economic
00:32:18.640 conditions of the area it serves new
00:32:21.200 suncook school has earned a national
00:32:23.200 reputation for excellence
00:32:26.720 it's a reputation that started with the
00:32:28.799 arrival of principal gary mcdonald nine
00:32:31.600 years ago we think we can make a
00:32:33.600 difference we think the teachers can
00:32:35.039 make a difference and that we think that
00:32:38.399 we can
00:32:39.519 enable and create environments that
00:32:43.600 help students to be confident and
00:32:45.679 competent in their learning and that
00:32:48.720 learning is seen as being
00:32:50.640 not just for students it's part of the
00:32:53.039 entire
00:32:54.240 school culture how are you doing
00:32:57.919 i guess i'm just
00:32:59.279 researching
00:33:00.559 that school culture is striking to a
00:33:02.720 first time visitor
00:33:04.480 instead of teachers delivering lessons
00:33:07.039 students seem to be on their own when
00:33:09.279 one comes in and they see kids in the
00:33:11.919 halls and they see kids in small groups
00:33:14.399 and in large groups the next step is for
00:33:16.480 somebody to really investigate what are
00:33:18.159 those kids doing he's longer
00:33:20.960 yeah that one's longer x equals
00:33:25.760 10 over 6.
00:33:27.519 you have children sitting in a small
00:33:29.200 group sitting by themselves
00:33:31.279 and they're actively engaged in learning
00:33:33.840 that to me means that they have an
00:33:35.200 investment in their learning and the the
00:33:37.440 result is going to be
00:33:38.960 a great deal more successful
00:33:40.960 than if somebody is telling them that
00:33:42.640 they have to sit there and have to do a
00:33:44.640 certain event because it's time to do
00:33:46.240 that and the curriculum calls for that
00:33:48.720 one word heard often around new son cook
00:33:51.200 is choices
00:33:52.480 and nowhere are choices more apparent
00:33:54.720 than in the multi-age classrooms who and
00:33:57.360 what is different
00:33:58.720 and i think mrs steller has a couple of
00:34:00.320 new centers also
00:34:02.080 at the listening center you can read i
00:34:05.200 know an old lady
00:34:06.960 and listen to the tape
00:34:09.280 and at the math center you have to do a
00:34:12.079 sequencing activity right so you're
00:34:14.159 going to put things in the right order
00:34:16.239 and today is the last day to do an
00:34:19.199 insect puzzle in the art center
00:34:21.918 see this little thing on the end of it
00:34:24.079 that's what they mean by club
00:34:26.079 multi-age classes are one feature of new
00:34:28.480 sun cook
00:34:29.679 kindergarten first grade and second
00:34:31.599 grade are all grouped together and for
00:34:34.719 one hour each day there's something
00:34:36.560 called centering
00:34:39.679 the children are free to choose from a
00:34:41.760 wide range of learning center activities
00:34:45.119 creative writing art
00:34:47.280 perhaps just drawing a birthday card
00:34:51.520 you can draw a picture
00:34:53.280 you can draw a picture inside
00:34:56.079 you can
00:34:57.359 draw something on the back you can do
00:34:59.440 balloons anything you can
00:35:08.560 and every activity no matter how
00:35:10.800 unimportant it looks has a purpose
00:35:13.760 they get to see how um rice will pour
00:35:16.800 out easily out of some containers and
00:35:18.400 not out of others
00:35:19.920 and um
00:35:21.359 they're just discovering on their own
00:35:22.880 what they can do with these discouraging
00:35:25.359 within years to come they'll be studying
00:35:26.960 volume
00:35:28.079 and they'll be studying measuring and
00:35:30.480 they'll be able to see you know they'll
00:35:32.400 have already played played with the um
00:35:34.400 containers and things
00:35:36.160 linda duchene has taught at new suncook
00:35:38.400 for 12 years
00:35:40.160 she and lauren potter were instrumental
00:35:42.320 in starting the multi-age classes four
00:35:44.720 years ago
00:35:46.160 their primary consideration was children
00:35:49.040 and how they learn
00:35:51.040 i think we
00:35:52.400 really work hard at trying to
00:35:56.079 think like a child think about how child
00:35:59.440 children put the world together and then
00:36:01.920 we try to take the information that
00:36:04.320 we're trying to give to them and bring
00:36:06.240 it to them in a way that makes sense to
00:36:08.960 them and not isolated and separated in
00:36:11.839 little pieces and expect them to make
00:36:14.400 the connections the various activities
00:36:16.720 may look haphazard but everything is
00:36:19.119 planned in intricate detail
00:36:21.440 for example
00:36:22.640 linda dushane and karen johnson meet
00:36:24.800 every morning to develop a lesson plan
00:36:26.880 for the day
00:36:28.160 i didn't know whether we could use this
00:36:30.079 whether um
00:36:31.440 a pop-up beak thing after we've done the
00:36:33.920 bake
00:36:34.640 the beaks whether i haven't tried to put
00:36:36.079 one together again yet even if they just
00:36:37.680 do they don't have to make a story they
00:36:39.119 can just do it with the art time yeah
00:36:42.160 the plan is followed when their classes
00:36:44.160 are combined for the one hour of
00:36:45.839 centering time
00:36:47.440 two teachers and fifty young children
00:36:50.079 who choose their own activities
00:36:53.599 the children are in control of their
00:36:55.440 choices
00:36:56.800 but the teacher is
00:36:59.119 responsible for finding out the needs of
00:37:00.960 the kids and giving them choices within
00:37:04.800 a range of activities and when you have
00:37:07.119 children long enough you can almost tell
00:37:08.960 when a child is choosing something
00:37:10.560 because it's easy
00:37:12.079 or because it's
00:37:14.079 um he'll get done quickly
00:37:16.720 or if he's choosing it because it's a
00:37:18.240 challenge
00:37:31.280 right now it's time for you to clean up
00:37:32.720 your space and go to your meeting area
00:37:34.560 there's no doubt the teachers are in
00:37:36.640 control
00:37:37.839 and they're expected to produce
00:37:39.599 measurable results there's a tremendous
00:37:41.839 amount of assessment that goes on within
00:37:45.200 a day
00:37:46.480 and within the center time
00:37:48.400 a real assessment of where each of the
00:37:50.079 children are at as they move through
00:37:51.599 their center time and that's the part
00:37:53.680 that we begin to talk about as staff as
00:37:56.240 to
00:37:57.280 what is the appropriateness of the
00:37:59.280 activity and it comes back to the
00:38:00.800 question we ask often during the day is
00:38:02.800 what are we doing and why are we doing
00:38:04.240 it we feel that the activities in here
00:38:06.720 are beneficial to children that there's
00:38:09.359 learning taking place and that they fit
00:38:11.280 into the context of the entire day
00:38:13.680 kids are involved in what they're
00:38:15.119 learning and
00:38:16.320 if you're going to be a lifelong learner
00:38:18.720 you have to want to learn and
00:38:20.880 if we're excited about learning the kids
00:38:22.480 are excited about learning
00:38:24.640 so yes
00:38:26.160 let me just give you a really brief
00:38:28.320 overview of the school for those that
00:38:30.160 aren't aware of it and then
00:38:32.480 you can just fire questions at us each
00:38:34.480 spring gary mcdonald meets with parents
00:38:37.040 whose children will be enrolling at new
00:38:38.880 son cook the following year
00:38:41.119 many have reservations about the
00:38:42.720 multi-age classrooms until they're
00:38:45.119 reassured by other parents school and i
00:38:47.680 had started to come in to volunteer i
00:38:49.760 was so overwhelmed i thought how is he
00:38:51.599 learning anything because you know i was
00:38:53.040 at my desk when i was a little girl and
00:38:54.640 that's how you learn and you did this
00:38:56.000 and you did this but my michael his
00:38:58.480 first year school excelled in math flew
00:39:01.040 with it just couldn't believe how smart
00:39:03.440 this kid was now by itself multi-aging
00:39:06.640 is not the answer it's the idea of the
00:39:08.320 instructional practices
00:39:10.000 the type of learning that's taking place
00:39:12.560 and that's really done throughout the
00:39:14.240 building
00:39:16.400 in fact the building is filled with
00:39:18.640 teachers who continually search for new
00:39:20.960 ways to encourage learning
00:39:23.280 linda bradley's third graders are
00:39:25.040 practicing with fractions but not from a
00:39:27.520 book okay let's see if we can take some
00:39:29.440 of them away now what's our total group
00:39:31.680 that we start with
00:39:33.359 jason three thirds three thirds so how
00:39:36.400 do we say one and a three is a girl
00:39:39.040 one third of the group is a girl have
00:39:41.280 you tried him first by himself to see if
00:39:43.200 he will do it without any training
00:39:45.760 meanwhile rhonda poliquin's 4th grade
00:39:48.240 class is studying meal worms
00:39:52.560 for the most part they work on their own
00:39:54.800 in small groups
00:39:57.119 his arm is still out it's not across his
00:39:59.440 chest yet
00:40:00.720 he got really shiny
00:40:02.480 the class is an example of gary
00:40:04.240 mcdonald's favorite saying
00:40:06.480 students shouldn't be consumers of
00:40:08.319 knowledge they should be producers of
00:40:10.720 knowledge what it means is that in lots
00:40:13.440 of situations students
00:40:15.359 are sitting in their classroom being
00:40:17.599 receivers of information that somebody
00:40:19.440 is speaking to them
00:40:22.240 what we'd rather
00:40:24.480 think that we're doing is putting kids
00:40:26.480 into situations where
00:40:28.480 um they're actually taking that and
00:40:30.880 applying it and
00:40:33.119 creating again situations for the kids
00:40:35.200 where they need to problem solve and
00:40:39.040 be critical thinkers
00:40:40.640 and that they're the ones that are
00:40:42.079 producing those pieces of knowledge
00:40:44.160 instead of simply sitting there and
00:40:45.520 listening
00:40:46.560 even when a class is conducted in the
00:40:48.480 traditional way teacher up front
00:40:50.880 students in their seats
00:40:52.640 there's an attempt to make learning an
00:40:54.400 active process okay so what do we need
00:40:56.960 to do first
00:40:58.560 um
00:40:59.520 morgan how many times does 7 go into 43
00:41:05.280 and it's 42. it goes in 42 times
00:41:08.720 it goes in
00:41:10.400 six times six i got 42. where did you
00:41:12.640 add the extra stuff
00:41:14.880 i already brought down this one brought
00:41:16.960 the same number down twice right hey
00:41:19.119 good for you what's that word
00:41:21.280 new sun cook students are encouraged to
00:41:23.359 be creative
00:41:24.800 so are the teachers
00:41:26.720 they're free to try anything to reach
00:41:28.800 children as long as it works i'm not
00:41:31.599 comfortable with sitting in my office
00:41:33.920 and saying that everyone needs to teach
00:41:35.599 in a certain way
00:41:37.119 i trust the professional i trust the
00:41:39.359 professional classroom make decisions
00:41:41.200 based on the needs of the group and the
00:41:42.800 individuals in that group to meet the
00:41:44.720 outcomes the accountability aspect comes
00:41:46.880 in
00:41:47.599 in
00:41:48.640 when
00:41:49.599 we check the outcomes and to be sure
00:41:51.359 that those outcomes are being met yeah
00:41:53.440 he just eats and eats and eats and eats
00:41:55.119 and eats what's he eating there those
00:41:56.800 outcomes are judged in various ways
00:41:59.839 every child at new son cook is
00:42:01.599 continually monitored to determine
00:42:03.839 strengths and weaknesses
00:42:05.920 and there are standardized tests in
00:42:08.079 reading
00:42:09.520 writing and math new suncook scores are
00:42:12.160 in the top 20 percent of all main
00:42:14.560 schools
00:42:15.680 this academic success is partly due to
00:42:18.079 the atmosphere that's been created at
00:42:20.319 new suncook we kind of share what the
00:42:22.800 problem with the book is rosie white's
00:42:24.880 class is reading a novel called tuck
00:42:26.960 everlasting
00:42:28.240 in the novel one character can drink
00:42:30.480 from a stream and live forever
00:42:33.200 do you think winnie's gonna drink the
00:42:34.720 water or do you not think when he's
00:42:37.200 gonna drink the water and why i think
00:42:39.599 when he will follow tuck's advice and
00:42:42.000 not drink the water because um
00:42:46.079 you know she she might not want to live
00:42:48.160 forever
00:42:49.839 kitty well i think if everybody drank it
00:42:53.520 and there's lots of kids in the world if
00:42:55.040 they drank it too
00:42:56.400 then there wouldn't be as many people
00:42:57.839 born and like if
00:43:00.400 let's say albert
00:43:01.960 einstein's mother was young or something
00:43:04.960 and she drank it then he would never be
00:43:06.880 born why why are they these are fifth
00:43:09.680 graders
00:43:10.720 but the atmosphere is more like that of
00:43:12.800 a college classroom i think the more you
00:43:15.599 expect of children the higher they reach
00:43:18.000 i mean you're not going to set goals
00:43:19.359 that you know they can't attain but
00:43:21.839 kids really like to talk and if they
00:43:24.000 really like to have the feeling that
00:43:26.800 their view is really respected and i
00:43:29.520 think a lot of people in this building
00:43:31.119 besides myself really believe in doing
00:43:32.880 that
00:43:34.000 if you drank that water while you were
00:43:35.599 wicked sick you'd stay sick you'd never
00:43:38.000 get better you'd never get worse
00:43:41.040 that means and i drink it when i'm
00:43:44.000 99
00:43:45.599 you think you'll live to be 99 probably
00:43:48.319 my grandfather did oh all right respect
00:43:50.640 for children is evident throughout the
00:43:52.839 school there's also a widespread respect
00:43:55.760 for parents
00:43:57.599 they're invited to spend as much time as
00:43:59.599 possible in the classroom
00:44:02.240 valerie wilfong has two children at new
00:44:04.400 suncook she volunteers two mornings a
00:44:07.119 week he thought it was gonna be a cat
00:44:09.520 well it's great for parents for one
00:44:11.200 thing to be able to be part of what's
00:44:12.960 happening and see what's happening in
00:44:14.480 the classroom and it's it's great where
00:44:16.640 all the children are working at their
00:44:18.319 own pace to be able to have an extra
00:44:20.400 pair of hands to listen to to one group
00:44:23.280 all the teachers working more
00:44:24.319 intensively with someone else
00:44:26.160 so i think it is a great
00:44:28.640 great benefit for everybody i have
00:44:31.040 several parent volunteers and i really
00:44:32.800 depend on them when they're here because
00:44:34.319 they just it's like an extra hand and
00:44:36.480 they really want to know what's going on
00:44:37.760 in the school and it's great to have
00:44:39.040 them here to be able to for their help
00:44:40.880 but also for their enthusiasm support
00:44:43.280 they can lend to the school
00:44:44.880 so they're not in the way at all
00:44:48.000 the school tries to expose students to
00:44:50.240 the world outside of rural maine
00:44:54.400 that's appreciated by parents like
00:44:56.240 brenda thibodeaux
00:44:57.680 she owns a large farm that grows trees
00:45:00.079 and potatoes
00:45:01.680 three of the thibodeau children have
00:45:03.280 attended new sun cook
00:45:05.119 they've come away with more than just a
00:45:07.040 sound education
00:45:08.720 nusanko provides the royal children an
00:45:11.440 opportunity to cultural enrichment to
00:45:13.280 see open their doors to see what's
00:45:15.119 outside of this small area what's in the
00:45:17.839 cities what's you know what it's like to
00:45:19.839 be elsewhere you know to bring that in
00:45:22.000 they've tried real hard to pull that
00:45:23.359 into the school
00:45:26.160 part of that enrichment comes through
00:45:27.839 field trips
00:45:29.200 on this day a few classes are off on a
00:45:31.599 one-hour bus ride
00:45:35.280 destination the main conservation school
00:45:39.920 each year new suncook has a theme
00:45:42.400 this year it's air and space
00:45:44.640 the students have been studying
00:45:46.000 ornithology and entomology for eight
00:45:48.160 months
00:45:49.760 insects having their homes on the logs
00:45:51.280 so let's look under this log and see if
00:45:52.640 we can find anything okay
00:45:55.350 
00:45:56.640 now it's time to get some real life
00:45:58.560 experience
00:46:02.319 what do you see it's a needle yeah don't
00:46:04.720 touch it might be poisonous oh it's okay
00:46:07.520 we try to have kids um for the most part
00:46:10.480 have hands on and a lot of choice
00:46:13.280 and
00:46:15.040 so here what you're seeing is children
00:46:17.119 moving around experiencing what they're
00:46:20.560 trying to learn as opposed to just
00:46:22.400 sitting down and soaking it up with
00:46:24.319 someone telling them about it they're
00:46:25.680 experiencing it firsthand
00:46:33.040 learning that's integrated around the
00:46:34.880 theme of air and space
00:46:37.040 for language arts there's a story about
00:46:39.359 a caterpillar
00:46:41.200 he just thinks that he's never ever
00:46:42.800 going to turn into that butterfly so he
00:46:44.960 cries and cries and cries what is it you
00:46:47.359 want to do with it then there's art
00:46:49.760 combined with etymology
00:46:52.319 the children are asked to make their own
00:46:54.240 insect
00:47:08.160 all this is obviously a great deal of
00:47:10.400 fun
00:47:11.680 what are these funny things up top
00:47:15.760 what so they can get mtv
00:47:18.800 what are the antennas for
00:47:20.640 sit so they won't die
00:47:23.200 but it's more than just fun
00:47:25.280 a fact that isn't lost on these children
00:47:28.079 by learning that there's different kinds
00:47:30.079 of insects and
00:47:32.079 that people are like cutting down trees
00:47:35.839 that where butterflies migrate
00:47:38.720 so the butterflies die because they
00:47:40.559 don't have no place to go in the winter
00:47:44.079 thing you need have you done wings or
00:47:45.920 anything back at school the integrated
00:47:48.400 learning continues
00:47:50.079 students are encouraged to write about
00:47:51.920 the insects they saw
00:47:53.599 once again the knowledge comes from the
00:47:56.079 children
00:48:03.599 you didn't put down the three body parts
00:48:04.880 do you know what they are
00:48:06.880 yes you do
00:48:08.400 what are they
00:48:11.920 head thorax
00:48:14.400 
00:48:23.119 even in music class where students are
00:48:25.359 getting ready for a school performance
00:48:27.520 the songs are about flowers and insects
00:48:33.760 this week includes another field trip
00:48:36.319 this one for teachers
00:48:38.400 news on cook's theme next year will be
00:48:40.400 water and the teachers have to learn
00:48:42.800 before they can teach
00:48:48.480 they'll be bringing their classes to
00:48:50.000 this bog and the children will be asked
00:48:52.400 to search for bugs and worms
00:48:54.960 when you bring your kids here uh that uh
00:48:58.160 getting right down and digging in just
00:48:59.680 like you're doing is very important to
00:49:01.440 show that you're not afraid to pick up
00:49:03.760 squiggly things in the mud because you
00:49:06.240 know nothing's going to hurt you here oh
00:49:08.240 we have something here we go this one
00:49:09.440 this one yeah
00:49:10.559 this field trip is voluntary but it's
00:49:13.200 attended by nearly every teacher in the
00:49:15.359 school
00:49:16.400 certainly in a school like new suncook
00:49:18.160 and i think a lot of schools but it's
00:49:19.520 really committed people these people are
00:49:21.520 out on their own they're involved in
00:49:23.359 their staff development activity
00:49:25.359 really they can relate back to the
00:49:26.640 classroom and can relate to trying to
00:49:28.559 make better things for kids in
00:49:29.839 classrooms part of the framework of
00:49:32.079 of what your job involves when you're
00:49:34.079 actively involving kids is to
00:49:36.880 i mean you have to become involved
00:49:38.400 yourself you can't just learn it from a
00:49:40.480 book and i was just saying on the way up
00:49:42.400 here just you know walking i've learned
00:49:43.839 so much just the stuff that we've tried
00:49:45.359 to present to kids and have them
00:49:46.640 experience
00:49:48.079 stuff that i certainly didn't know
00:49:49.839 i want to find a little the teachers at
00:49:51.440 nissan cook seemed to work as a genuine
00:49:53.920 team
00:49:55.280 in many ways so do the students their
00:49:58.480 learning is usually done in groups
00:50:00.880 meaning they have to get along
00:50:03.040 that idea of cooperative education is
00:50:05.680 stressed throughout the school even in
00:50:08.079 physical education
00:50:09.760 and that's the yellow team
00:50:11.520 biz ed specialist robert davis
00:50:13.680 emphasizes cooperation not competition
00:50:17.760 in this game the object is to knock a
00:50:20.000 tennis ball off a pylon
00:50:22.720 students quickly learn that the best way
00:50:24.640 to do it is by passing to their
00:50:26.559 teammates
00:50:29.680 if they can't get along with each other
00:50:30.880 they're not going to be able to focus on
00:50:33.599 psychomotor skills so and that's
00:50:35.599 my philosophy of physical education
00:50:37.040 that's probably the most important part
00:50:39.760 is that um
00:50:41.280 that they learn how to get along with
00:50:42.559 each other that's the effect of
00:50:44.240 development in children i think is very
00:50:46.400 important and this can is a great medium
00:50:48.559 to to focus on that
00:50:50.559 that next day i was in a christmas
00:50:53.920 meanwhile this cooperative exercise is
00:50:56.559 meant to focus on creative writing
00:50:59.520 once a week students of all ages gather
00:51:02.160 in small groups
00:51:03.680 they take turns reading stories they've
00:51:05.920 written and asking for help
00:51:09.839 anyway
00:51:10.880 i
00:51:11.599 can make my story there it's really a
00:51:13.760 little confusing you need to organize it
00:51:15.760 a little more i bet um the story would
00:51:18.640 be
00:51:20.079 good if you added on to it
00:51:23.920 the effort to encourage cooperation
00:51:26.079 extends throughout new suncook
00:51:28.640 each day older students volunteer to
00:51:31.040 pass some of their knowledge on to
00:51:32.800 younger
00:51:35.200 he's in ones i'm in fifth grade and um
00:51:38.720 they're learning fractions and the fifth
00:51:40.640 graders are here to help them yeah it's
00:51:42.480 fun and we get the choice if we want to
00:51:44.480 come down here or not
00:51:46.000 they used to teach them how to do stuff
00:51:47.359 and set a good example for you when he
00:51:49.359 gets up there that's what he does when
00:51:50.800 he gets down here the purpose isn't just
00:51:53.520 to have kids teaching one another facts
00:51:56.240 it's also a perfect example of modeling
00:51:58.880 have you finished it
00:52:00.400 what is not one system
00:52:02.400 modeling is um children looking up to
00:52:05.359 other children and doing what they're
00:52:06.640 doing
00:52:09.040 it's not just the teacher who's going to
00:52:10.960 model something for another child it's
00:52:12.960 kids can model for other children
00:52:15.040 teaching them how to write a young child
00:52:17.280 oh you're writing and those kids will
00:52:19.520 just start copying them who would like
00:52:22.079 to review the rules in order to foster
00:52:24.400 even greater cooperation rosie white
00:52:27.040 uses something called the magic circle
00:52:30.079 for one hour each week her students are
00:52:32.559 free to talk or complain about anything
00:52:34.880 they want
00:52:36.079 a student is in charge and rosie white
00:52:38.720 is just another participant
00:52:41.920 on someone in the other room
00:52:45.119 um
00:52:46.960 at snack time he came up to me
00:52:50.000 and he this is gross he opened his mouth
00:52:52.960 with food in it
00:52:54.400 and he spit it at me
00:52:56.240 how did you handle it i said someone's
00:52:58.160 name and i said that's gross and i'm
00:53:01.119 definitely black
00:53:02.480 it's not really group therapy it's it's
00:53:04.559 part of my philosophy of making kids
00:53:06.880 feel good about themselves and learning
00:53:09.359 that they can say what they want
00:53:11.680 and their opinion counts
00:53:13.440 and they can solve problems or
00:53:16.559 injustices maybe is a better word
00:53:18.559 vocally rather than keeping them inside
00:53:20.720 themselves or physically dealing with
00:53:22.160 them and then the kids have been from
00:53:24.079 parker's class think they're so cool
00:53:26.160 like they're going around well they're
00:53:28.800 always thinking they're so cool
00:53:32.319 the magic circle might seem like pop
00:53:34.400 psychology
00:53:35.680 but again it's intended to encourage
00:53:38.319 learning counting
00:53:40.000 and only a couple of people seem to
00:53:41.440 argue for students to be able to learn
00:53:44.079 they need to feel comfortable about
00:53:45.680 themselves and to get the most out of
00:53:47.920 what you can teach them to feel they're
00:53:50.000 respected their va you know their
00:53:52.079 opinion is valued
00:53:53.839 and they're worth something
00:53:56.240 and so i think the mood in a room is so
00:53:58.480 important
00:54:00.480 one thing is very noticeable around new
00:54:02.800 suncook there's very little emphasis on
00:54:05.440 discipline
00:54:06.720 according to gary mcdonald that's a side
00:54:09.440 effect of the school environment
00:54:12.400 someone might see this as being a
00:54:16.480 laid-back situation on the other hand
00:54:19.119 it's structured to such an extent in
00:54:21.359 many ways that discipline does not
00:54:23.359 become a problem because the kids are
00:54:24.720 always engaged
00:54:26.079 and they're always involved and they're
00:54:28.000 invested in their learning and they're
00:54:29.359 raising questions and
00:54:31.599 when when children are in those
00:54:33.680 situations i think the discipline
00:54:35.200 becomes less of a factor if children
00:54:37.440 talking to children is inappropriate
00:54:39.359 behavior
00:54:40.559 then
00:54:41.520 i guess we have no discipline but we
00:54:43.839 feel that
00:54:45.359 children learning to talk to each other
00:54:47.760 cooperate work together is preparing
00:54:50.480 them for their life way down the line
00:54:53.119 and
00:54:54.240 working
00:54:55.359 in team projects
00:54:57.520 so that isn't an issue
00:54:59.680 new suncook has the most extensive
00:55:02.079 special education program in the
00:55:03.920 district it's the receiving school for
00:55:06.480 children with severe emotional and
00:55:08.400 learning disabilities
00:55:10.400 and those children are taught much like
00:55:12.480 all the other children
00:55:14.880 alice holt is one of three full-time
00:55:17.280 special ed teachers
00:55:19.119 she spends part of her day on intensive
00:55:21.520 individual instruction did you know that
00:55:23.680 was a sentence
00:55:25.920 yes you did know
00:55:28.000 then how come he didn't put a capital at
00:55:29.520 the beginning of it
00:55:31.680 can he fix it
00:55:33.359 but most of her time is spent in regular
00:55:35.839 classrooms
00:55:37.359 she's there to help all the students
00:55:39.839 not just those who are labeled special
00:55:41.839 ed what we're trying to do is have the
00:55:43.920 kids become
00:55:45.839 really members of the classroom instead
00:55:48.000 of
00:55:48.799 separate
00:55:50.160 there's so many times where i'd come to
00:55:52.000 a classroom and uh
00:55:53.839 and it might be you know bobby mrs
00:55:56.160 halt's here to get you you know and now
00:55:57.520 there's none of that it's so you come in
00:55:58.960 the classroom and you're sort of freebie
00:56:00.640 for anybody that might want you and
00:56:02.960 there's lots of kids in the middle who
00:56:04.240 just want
00:56:05.280 a question answered or
00:56:07.200 you know a little bit of help or some
00:56:08.559 attention for something good that they
00:56:10.000 did and they they love it to have
00:56:11.599 somebody else that they can talk to
00:56:13.440 cooperative learning
00:56:15.520 multi-age grouping
00:56:17.520 integrated curriculum
00:56:19.760 a positive environment great job are you
00:56:22.640 proud of yourself these elements and
00:56:24.400 many others have played a role in making
00:56:26.880 new suncook an exemplary school it's the
00:56:30.319 culmination of a process that began nine
00:56:32.960 years ago
00:56:34.079 when gary mcdonald and his staff got
00:56:36.400 together to write down their vision
00:56:39.280 then turned it into a reality my vision
00:56:42.240 i think the vision of the school and a
00:56:43.680 lot of the activities we do is that kids
00:56:45.599 are lifelong learners and that learning
00:56:48.319 doesn't stop
00:56:49.599 learning is a lifelong activity it
00:56:51.440 doesn't it isn't only in school it's not
00:56:54.640 only in class it happens in many many
00:56:56.720 different activities many different
00:56:58.240 avenues and that hopefully people
00:57:00.799 recognize that and that schooling is not
00:57:03.040 the only place that it can happen
00:57:04.880 but all those
00:57:06.319 put together create a
00:57:08.160 context which hopefully maximize an
00:57:10.240 individual's capacity to do what they
00:57:12.480 would like to do with their life and to
00:57:13.760 be a contributing member of society
00:57:18.800 
00:57:45.200 so
00:57:48.600 
00:58:05.599 hey
